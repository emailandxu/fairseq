SAID MARILLA AS IF GETTING BOYS FROM ORPHAN ASYLUMS IN NOVA SCOTIA WERE PART OF THE USUAL SPRING WORK ON ANY WELL REGULATED AVONLEA FARM INSTEAD OF BEING AN UNHEARD OF INNOVATION MISSUS RACHEL FELT THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE MENTAL JOLT SHE THOUGHT IN EXCLAMATION POINTS
HELPED RUN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AND WAS THE STRONGEST PROP OF THE CHURCH AID SOCIETY AND FOREIGN MISSIONS AUXILIARY YET WITH ALL THIS MISSUS RACHEL FOUND ABUNDANT TIME TO SIT FOR HOURS AT HER KITCHEN WINDOW KNITTING COTTON WARP QUILTS SHE HAD KNITTED SIXTEEN OF THEM
ANYBODY WHO WENT OUT OF IT OR INTO IT HAD TO PASS OVER THAT HILL ROAD AND SO RUN THE UNSEEN GAUNTLET OF MISSUS RACHEL'S ALL SEEING EYE SHE WAS SITTING THERE ONE AFTERNOON IN EARLY JUNE THE SUN WAS COMING IN AT THE WINDOW WARM AND BRIGHT
PETER HAD ASKED HIM OF COURSE FOR MATTHEW CUTHBERT HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET HERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT AT HALF PAST THREE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A BUSY DAY PLACIDLY DRIVING OVER THE HOLLOW AND UP THE HILL
MARILLA AND MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF ALL PEOPLE ADOPTING A BOY FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM WELL THE WORLD WAS CERTAINLY TURNING UPSIDE DOWN SHE WOULD BE SURPRISED AT NOTHING AFTER THIS NOTHING
OLD ENOUGH TO BE OF SOME USE IN DOING CHORES RIGHT OFF AND YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE TRAINED UP PROPER WE MEAN TO GIVE HIM A GOOD HOME AND SCHOOLING WE HAD A TELEGRAM FROM MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER TODAY THE MAIL MAN BROUGHT IT FROM THE STATION SAYING THEY WERE COMING ON THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN TONIGHT
SO MATTHEW WENT TO BRIGHT RIVER TO MEET HIM MISSUS SPENCER WILL DROP HIM OFF THERE OF COURSE SHE GOES ON TO WHITE SANDS STATION HERSELF MISSUS RACHEL PRIDED HERSELF ON ALWAYS SPEAKING HER MIND SHE PROCEEDED TO SPEAK IT NOW HAVING ADJUSTED HER MENTAL ATTITUDE TO THIS AMAZING PIECE OF NEWS
HAD GOT AS FAR AWAY AS HE POSSIBLY COULD FROM HIS FELLOW MEN WITHOUT ACTUALLY RETREATING INTO THE WOODS WHEN HE FOUNDED HIS HOMESTEAD GREEN GABLES WAS BUILT AT THE FURTHEST EDGE OF HIS CLEARED LAND AND THERE IT WAS TO THIS DAY
THEY SEEM CONTENTED ENOUGH BUT THEN I SUPPOSE THEY'RE USED TO IT A BODY CAN GET USED TO ANYTHING EVEN TO BEING HANGED AS THE IRISHMAN SAID WITH THIS MISSUS RACHEL STEPPED OUT OF THE LANE INTO THE BACKYARD OF GREEN GABLES VERY GREEN AND NEAT AND PRECISE WAS THAT YARD
THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN HAS BEEN IN AND GONE HALF AN HOUR AGO ANSWERED THAT BRISK OFFICIAL BUT THERE WAS A PASSENGER DROPPED OFF FOR YOU A LITTLE GIRL SHE'S SITTING OUT THERE ON THE SHINGLES I ASKED HER TO GO INTO THE LADIES WAITING ROOM BUT SHE INFORMED ME GRAVELY THAT SHE PREFERRED TO STAY OUTSIDE
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BUT I CAN IMAGINE WHAT SHE WOULD LOOK LIKE I DON'T EVER EXPECT TO BE A BRIDE MYSELF I'M SO HOMELY NOBODY WILL EVER WANT TO MARRY ME UNLESS IT MIGHT BE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY I SUPPOSE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY MIGHTN'T BE VERY PARTICULAR
SHE SAID SHE HADN'T TIME TO GET SICK WATCHING TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T FALL OVERBOARD SHE SAID SHE NEVER SAW THE BEAT OF ME FOR PROWLING ABOUT BUT IF IT KEPT HER FROM BEING SEASICK IT'S A MERCY I DID PROWL ISN'T IT AND I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE SEEN ON THAT BOAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D EVER HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
HE DETESTED THE WAY THEY HAD OF SIDLING PAST HIM TIMIDLY WITH SIDEWISE GLANCES AS IF THEY EXPECTED HIM TO GOBBLE THEM UP AT A MOUTHFUL IF THEY VENTURED TO SAY A WORD THAT WAS THE AVONLEA TYPE OF WELL BRED LITTLE GIRL BUT THIS FRECKLED WITCH WAS VERY DIFFERENT
POSSIBLY MADAME AND NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT
OR WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE PROCUREUR WELL I HAVE BUSINESS WITH THE PROCUREUR IS IT PRESSING BUSINESS YOU CAN IMAGINE SO SINCE I HAVE NOT EVEN BROUGHT MY CARRIAGE OUT YET BUT ENOUGH OF THIS HERE IS MY CARD
PREOCCUPIED AS MADAME DANGLARS HAD BEEN WITH THE OBJECT OF HER VISIT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM THESE UNDERLINGS APPEARED TO HER SO INSULTING THAT SHE BEGAN BY COMPLAINING OF IT
YOU WISH TO SPEAK TO ME ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS JUST HAPPENED YES SIR A FEARFUL MISFORTUNE YOU MEAN A MISCHANCE A MISCHANCE REPEATED THE BARONESS ALAS MADAME
YOUR DAUGHTER WILL BE MARRIED TO MORROW IF NOT TO DAY IN A WEEK IF NOT TO MORROW AND I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN REGRET THE INTENDED HUSBAND OF YOUR DAUGHTER MADAME DANGLARS GAZED ON VILLEFORT STUPEFIED TO FIND HIM SO ALMOST INSULTINGLY CALM
AND WHEN IT COMMANDS IT STRIKES YOU WILL TELL ME THAT I AM A LIVING BEING AND NOT A CODE A MAN AND NOT A VOLUME LOOK AT ME MADAME
EVERY CRIMINAL I CONDEMN SEEMS TO ME LIVING EVIDENCE THAT I AM NOT A HIDEOUS EXCEPTION TO THE REST ALAS ALAS ALAS ALL THE WORLD IS WICKED LET US THEREFORE STRIKE AT WICKEDNESS
MADAME DANGLARS TREMBLED WITH FEAR VILLEFORT STARTED WITH JOY ARRESTED HE EXCLAIMED HE WAS TAKEN AT COMPIEGNE AND ALL IS OVER
BUT NO ON REFLECTION THE PROCUREUR WAS NOT A MERCILESS MAN AND IT WAS NOT THE MAGISTRATE SLAVE TO HIS DUTIES BUT THE FRIEND THE LOYAL FRIEND WHO ROUGHLY BUT FIRMLY CUT INTO THE VERY CORE OF THE CORRUPTION
NOW AFTER THE OATH I HAVE JUST TAKEN AND WHICH I WILL KEEP MADAME DARE YOU ASK FOR MERCY FOR THAT WRETCH BUT SIR ARE YOU SURE HE IS AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY LISTEN
MIND YOU I AM NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE A DRAWING ROOM BUT WE PRETEND WE HAVE AND IT'S ALL THE SAME HOOP LA HE WENT OFF DANCING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL CRIED HOOP LA AND DANCED AFTER HIM SEARCHING FOR THE DRAWING ROOM AND I FORGET WHETHER THEY FOUND IT
YOU HAVE MISSED A BIT INTERRUPTS JANE WHO NOW KNOWS THE STORY BETTER THAN HER MOTHER WHEN YOU SAW HIM SITTING ON THE FLOOR CRYING WHAT DID YOU SAY I SAT UP IN BED AND I SAID BOY WHY ARE YOU CRYING
JANE SAID AH YES MANY GIRLS HEAR IT WHEN THEY ARE SLEEPING BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD IT AWAKE LUCKY YOU SAID JANE AND THEN ONE NIGHT CAME THE TRAGEDY IT WAS THE SPRING OF THE YEAR
ALL THE BOYS WERE GROWN UP AND DONE FOR BY THIS TIME SO IT IS SCARCELY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM YOU MAY SEE THE TWINS AND NIBS AND CURLY ANY DAY GOING TO AN OFFICE EACH CARRYING A LITTLE BAG AND AN UMBRELLA
WHO WAS NO LONGER FOND OF STAIRS MISSUS DARLING WAS NOW DEAD AND FORGOTTEN THERE WERE ONLY TWO BEDS IN THE NURSERY NOW JANE'S AND HER NURSE'S AND THERE WAS NO KENNEL FOR NANA ALSO HAD PASSED AWAY
WHILE JANE IN HER NIGHTY WAS FLYING ROUND THE ROOM IN SOLEMN ECSTASY SHE IS MY MOTHER PETER EXPLAINED AND JANE DESCENDED AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE WITH THE LOOK IN HER FACE THAT HE LIKED TO SEE ON LADIES WHEN THEY GAZED AT HIM
I DON'T LIKE MISS STACKPOLE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER DISPLEASES ME SHE TALKS SO MUCH TOO LOUD AND LOOKS AT ONE AS IF ONE WANTED TO LOOK AT HER WHICH ONE DOESN'T
MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS RIGHT IN GUESSING THAT HENRIETTA DISAPPROVED OF HER BUT SHE HAD NOT QUITE PUT HER FINGER ON THE REASON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MISS STACKPOLE'S ARRIVAL
I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU WANT WITH FIVE HENRIETTA COULDN'T HELP OBSERVING I DON'T THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE FIVE PERSONS SURROUNDING ME IN THAT MENIAL POSITION
SHOULD YOU LIKE ME BETTER IF I WERE YOUR BUTLER DEAR HER HUSBAND ASKED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD YOU WOULDN'T AT ALL HAVE THE TENUE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN I LIKE THAT MISS STACKPOLE SAID RALPH
BUT SHE WAS NOTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS OCCASION OF THE FINITE CHARACTER OF BUNCHIE'S INTELLECT HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN MAINLY STRUCK WITH ITS EXTENT
AND HER IMAGINATION CONSTANTLY ANTICIPATED THE JUDGEMENTS AND EMOTIONS OF A WOMAN WHO HAD VERY LITTLE OF THE SAME FACULTY APART FROM THIS MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD A GREAT MERIT SHE WAS AS HONEST AS A PAIR OF COMPASSES
AS YET FOR REGARDING AS AGITATED BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PICTURING TO HERSELF BY THE LIGHT OF HER HOPES HER FEARS HER FANCIES HER AMBITIONS HER PREDILECTIONS
LIVID LIGHT OF A JUDGEMENT DAY THE GIRL MOREOVER WAS NOT PRONE TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE HERSELF LIVED IN THE MIND OF OTHERS
ON APRIL FOURTH A CONFERENCE WAS OPENED BETWEEN THE ENVOYS AND SIX COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY THE STATES TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT FOR A MORE STRICT AND INTIMATE ALLIANCE AND UNION BETWEEN THE TWO STATES THE DUTCH QUICKLY PERCEIVED
A MAN IN WHOSE RIPE JUDGMENT THEY HAD CONFIDENCE TO THE OFFICE OF COUNCIL PENSIONARY
THUS EARLY DID THE NEW COUNCIL PENSIONARY INITIATE A FORM OF DIPLOMACY IN WHICH HE WAS TO PROVE HIMSELF AN ADEPT THIS FIRST EFFORT WAS NOT A SUCCESS THE PARLIAMENT PUBLISHED THE LETTER WITH THE TITLE HUMBLE SUPPLICATION OF THE STATES OF HOLLAND
NEAR THE GABBARD THE ENGLISH FLEET UNDER MONK AND DEANE EACH FLEET NUMBERED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SAIL BUT THE DUTCH SHIPS WERE INFERIOR IN SIZE SOLIDITY AND WEIGHT OF METAL FOR TWO DAYS THE FIGHT WAS OBSTINATELY AND FIERCELY CONTESTED
THE STATES THOUGH MUCH PERPLEXED TO FIND A SUCCESSOR TO MARTIN TROMP WERE SO FAR FROM BEING DISCOURAGED THAT GREAT ENERGY WAS SHOWN IN REORGANISING THE FLEET
NOT TILL THE DUTCH ENVOYS HAD DEMANDED THEIR PASSPORTS DID THE PROTECTOR GIVE WAY SO FAR AS TO SAY HE WOULD BE CONTENT TO HAVE THE EXCLUSION GUARANTEED BY A SECRET ARTICLE WHAT FOLLOWED FORMS ONE OF THE STRANGEST CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF DIPLOMACY
AND IN LONG CRUISES TO THE WEST INDIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORCING THE ENGLISH COLONIES TO ACKNOWLEDGE PARLIAMENTARY RULE THE CREWS THEREFORE WERE WELL TRAINED AND THE SHIPS WERE LARGER STRONGER AND BETTER ARMED THAN THOSE OF THE DUTCH
AND WAS AVERSE TO WAR IN THE DUTCH REPUBLIC THE STATES PARTY ESPECIALLY IN HOLLAND THE CHIEF SUFFERER BY THE WAR WAS ANXIOUS FOR A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND IT FOUND ITS LEADER IN THE YOUTHFUL JOHN DE WITT
AND HE HAD MOREOVER BEEN AT SEA WITHOUT REPLENISHMENT OF STORES EVER SINCE THE FIGHT AT DUNGENESS WHILE THE ENGLISH HAD COME STRAIGHT FROM PORT THE FIGHT
THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO THE ENVOYS FOR NOT HAVING DELIVERED THE ACT TO CROMWELL DE WITT'S POSITION APPEARED HOPELESS
THERE IS HOWEVER EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT DE WITT WAS PROMPTED TO TAKE THE RISKS HE DID BY PURELY PATRIOTIC MOTIVES AND NOT THROUGH SPITE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ORANGE
SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER DIP IN EGG AND CORN MEAL AND FRY IN DEEP FAT
COOK WITH A TABLESPOONFUL EACH OF BUTTER AND FLOUR THICKENED TOGETHER TAKE FROM THE FIRE ADD A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER AND THE JUICE OF TWO LEMONS POUR OVER THE FISH AND SERVE
FOR PERSONS ARE LOVE'S WORLD AND THE COLDEST PHILOSOPHER CANNOT RECOUNT THE DEBT OF THE YOUNG SOUL WANDERING HERE IN NATURE TO THE POWER OF LOVE WITHOUT BEING TEMPTED TO UNSAY AS TREASONABLE TO NATURE AUGHT DEROGATORY TO THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
EVERY PROMISE OF THE SOUL HAS INNUMERABLE FULFILMENTS EACH OF ITS JOYS RIPENS INTO A NEW WANT NATURE UNCONTAINABLE FLOWING FORELOOKING
WHICH HAVE GIVEN HIM SINCEREST INSTRUCTION AND NOURISHMENT HE WILL SHRINK AND MOAN ALAS I KNOW NOT WHY BUT INFINITE COMPUNCTIONS EMBITTER IN MATURE LIFE THE REMEMBRANCES OF BUDDING JOY AND COVER EVERY BELOVED NAME
A MIDNIGHT BELL A PASSING GROAN THESE ARE THE SOUNDS WE FEED UPON BEHOLD THERE IN THE WOOD THE FINE MADMAN HE IS A PALACE OF SWEET SOUNDS AND SIGHTS HE DILATES HE IS TWICE A MAN
FISHER TOOK THE CARD FROM THE SALVER AND READ MISTER GEORGE GATHERCOLE JUNIOR TRAVELLERS CLUB I'LL SEE THIS GENTLEMAN HE SAID WITH A SUDDEN BRISK INTEREST HE FOUND THE VISITOR STANDING IN THE HALL
I FAIRLY GET THE CREEPS SITTING HERE HOUR AFTER HOUR IT'S THAT DOOR THAT GIVES ME THE HUMP SHE POINTED TO THE FAR END OF THE KITCHEN TO A SOILED LOOKING DOOR OF UNPAINTED WOOD THAT'S MISTER KARA'S WINE CELLAR NOBODY'S BEEN IN IT BUT HIM
AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST DRAWER DID NOT PRODUCE ALL THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED SHE RETURNED THE PAPERS TO THE DRAWER PUSHED IT TO AND LOCKED IT SHE GAVE HER ATTENTION TO THE SECOND DRAWER HER HAND SHOOK A LITTLE AS SHE PULLED IT OPEN
THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO KARA'S STUDY AND SET THE PAPERS IN ORDER WAS NATURAL AND PROPER THAT HE SHOULD CONDUCT A RAPID EXAMINATION OF ALL THE DRAWERS IN KARA'S DESK MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON THE SCORE OF DILIGENCE SINCE HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS EMPLOYER
MISTER FRED FISHER FOUND LITTLE TO REWARD HIM FOR HIS SEARCH UNTIL HE CAME UPON KARA'S CHEQUE BOOK WHICH TOLD HIM THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE GREEK HAD DRAWN SIX THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH FROM THE BANK
IT CARRIED HIM BACK A DOZEN YEARS TO A DIRTY LITTLE PEASANT'S CABIN ON THE HILLSIDE OUTSIDE DURAZZO TO THE LIVID FACE OF A YOUNG ALBANIAN CHIEF WHO HAD LOST AT KARA'S WHIM ALL THAT LIFE HELD FOR A MAN
SHE ASKED OF HER AUNT WHEN YOU CRITICISE EVERYTHING HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A POINT OF VIEW YOURS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMERICAN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO DISAGREEABLE WHEN I CRITICISE I HAVE MINE IT'S THOROUGHLY AMERICAN
FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
HE HAD DRIVEN OVER FROM HIS OWN PLACE WITH A PORTMANTEAU AND HAD ASKED AS THE FATHER AND SON OFTEN INVITED HIM TO DO FOR A DINNER AND A LODGING ISABEL SEEING HIM FOR HALF AN HOUR ON THE DAY OF HER ARRIVAL HAD DISCOVERED IN THIS BRIEF SPACE THAT SHE LIKED HIM
THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SOVEREIGN HER UNCLE WAS MORE AND MORE A SORT OF GOLDEN GRANDFATHER AND RALPH WAS UNLIKE ANY COUSIN SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED HER IDEA OF COUSINS HAVING TENDED TO GLOOM THEN
BUT WITHOUT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS FATHER'S SOCIETY HE SHOULD BARELY HAVE PATIENCE TO AWAIT HIS OWN TURN HE HAD NOT THE INCENTIVE OF FEELING THAT HE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO HIS MOTHER IT WAS A RULE WITH HIS MOTHER TO HAVE NO REGRETS
HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF COURSE THAT IT HAD BEEN A SMALL KINDNESS TO HIS FATHER TO WISH THAT OF THE TWO THE ACTIVE RATHER THAN THE PASSIVE PARTY SHOULD KNOW THE FELT WOUND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OLD MAN HAD ALWAYS TREATED HIS OWN FORECAST OF AN EARLY END AS A CLEVER FALLACY
THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED WHICH MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO PUT HER GOOD HUMOUR TO THE TEST
ISABEL CONSIDERED I'M NOT VEXED BUT I'M SURPRISED AND A GOOD DEAL MYSTIFIED WASN'T IT PROPER I SHOULD REMAIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOT IN THE LEAST YOUNG GIRLS HERE IN DECENT HOUSES
DON'T SIT ALONE WITH THE GENTLEMEN LATE AT NIGHT YOU WERE VERY RIGHT TO TELL ME THEN SAID ISABEL I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT I'M VERY GLAD TO KNOW IT I SHALL ALWAYS TELL YOU HER AUNT ANSWERED WHENEVER I SEE YOU TAKING WHAT SEEMS TO ME TOO MUCH LIBERTY
THE FORTUNATE LORD WARBURTON EXCHANGED A HANDSHAKE WITH OUR HEROINE AND HOPED SHE WAS VERY WELL BUT I NEEDN'T ASK THAT HE SAID SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING THE OARS I'VE BEEN ROWING A LITTLE ISABEL ANSWERED BUT HOW SHOULD YOU KNOW IT
WELL GO THEN SINCE YOU MUST BUT FIRST I WILL DIVIDE WITH YOU ALL THAT MY PARENTS LEFT ME AND GOING TO HER ROOM SHE OPENED A SMALL CHEST AND TOOK FROM IT A BELL A KNIFE AND A LITTLE STICK THIS BELL SHE SAID CAN BE HEARD AT ANY DISTANCE HOWEVER FAR
AS SOON AS THE YOUNG MAN HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE HE PREPARED TO JUMP INTO THE LAKE AND SWIM TO SHORE BUT THE BIRD HAD GUESSED HIS INTENTIONS AND PLUNGED BENEATH THE WATER
AND MY WET LINEN TO BE STRETCHED ON THE HEDGE TO DRY AND SHE NEED NEVER GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE MATTER IF SHE FOUND THE RYE BREAD TOO HARD TO BAKE OR THE OVEN TAKING TOO LONG TO HEAT SHE JUST MURMURED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY SIX LOAVES ON THE SHELF ABOVE THE BREAD BOX
A CHAMELEON CHANGES COLOR EASILY TO MATCH ITS ENVIRONMENT OR TEMPER OF THE MOMENT BUT A HUMAN BEING'S MORE LASTING CHANGE IS NOT SO READILY MADE EACH MARRIAGE PARTNER MUST BE PROUD OF THE OTHER AND LET THE OTHER CONTINUE TO BE PROUD OF HIM OR HER
THE FACTOR THAT UNDERLIES ALL THE PERPLEXITIES AND MOST OF THE CONTENTMENT OF MARRIAGE IS ITS UNIQUE DEGREE OF CONCENTRATED INTIMACY HERE THE SUPREME TESTING ALWAYS COMES EACH MEANS SO MUCH TO THE OTHER

PAY HIM WILL YOU JENKINS THANKS
FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
TRUE AS I LIVE OR HOPE I'LL DIE IF IT ISN'T SO OR SIMPLY HOPE I'LL DIE

BEING A GOOD MOOSULMAUN HE WASHED HIS HANDS FACE AND FEET AND SAID HIS PRAYERS BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED AND WHILE HE WAS YET ON HIS KNEES HE SAW A GENIE WHITE WITH AGE
PARDON ME CRIED THE MERCHANT NO PARDON EXCLAIMED THE GENIE NO MERCY IS IT NOT JUST TO KILL HIM THAT HAS KILLED ANOTHER
REPLIED THE MERCHANT BUT CERTAINLY I NEVER KILLED YOUR SON AND IF I HAVE IT WAS UNKNOWN TO ME AND I DID IT INNOCENTLY I BEG YOU THEREFORE TO PARDON ME AND SUFFER ME TO LIVE NO NO RETURNED THE GENIE
PROTESTED HE WAS INNOCENT BEWAILED HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND SUPPLICATED THE GENIE IN THE MOST MOVING EXPRESSIONS THE GENIE WITH HIS CIMETER STILL LIFTED UP HAD THE PATIENCE TO HEAR HIS UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS TO THE END OF HIS LAMENTATIONS
THE SULTAN WITHOUT WAITING FOR SCHEHERAZADE TO ASK HIS PERMISSION BADE HER PROCEED WITH THE STORY OF THE GENIE AND THE MERCHANT UPON WHICH SCHEHERAZADE CONTINUED HER RELATION AS FOLLOWS F N
THE CHILDREN ALL IN TEARS MADE THE HOUSE RESOUND WITH THEIR GROANS AND THE FATHER NOT BEING ABLE TO RESIST THE IMPULSE OF NATURE MINGLED HIS TEARS WITH THEIRS SO THAT IN A WORD THEY EXHIBITED THE MOST AFFECTING SPECTACLE POSSIBLE
BROTHER MAY I ASK WHY YOU ARE COME INTO THIS DESERT PLACE WHICH IS POSSESSED SOLELY BY EVIL SPIRITS AND WHERE CONSEQUENTLY YOU CANNOT BE SAFE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL TREES WHICH ARE SEEN HERE ONE MIGHT INDEED SUPPOSE THE PLACE INHABITED
SUFFERED HER TO LIVE THAT DAY ALSO THE NEXT MORNING DINARZADE MADE THE SAME REQUEST TO HER SISTER AS BEFORE MY DEAR SISTER SAID SHE
BUT THE SULTAN WISHING TO LEARN WHAT FOLLOWED BETWIXT THE MERCHANT AND THE GENIE BADE HER PROCEED WITH THAT WHICH SHE DID AS FOLLOWS SIR WHILE THE MERCHANT AND THE OLD MAN WHO LED THE HIND WERE CONVERSING
THAT I WOULD HAVE ANOTHER CALF TO SACRIFICE AND NOT THAT SHE USED ALL HER ENDEAVOURS TO PERSUADE ME TO CHANGE MY RESOLUTION BUT I CONTINUED FIRM
ONLY I MUST PRAY YOU NOT TO TAKE HER LIFE I AM GOING THEN ANSWERED SHE TO TREAT HER AS SHE TREATED YOUR SON TO THIS I CONSENT SAID I
BUT IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT YOU WILL MAKE YOUR DELIVERER YOUR WIFE AS I HAVE PROMISED HE JOYFULLY CONSENTED BUT BEFORE THEY MARRIED SHE CHANGED MY WIFE INTO A HIND AND THIS IS SHE WHOM YOU SEE HERE
OR EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS THE KING LISTENED TO WHAT HE SAID AND ANSWERED IF YOU BE ABLE TO PERFORM WHAT YOU PROMISE I WILL ENRICH YOU AND YOUR POSTERITY
DO YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL CURE MY LEPROSY WITHOUT POTION OR APPLYING ANY EXTERNAL MEDICINE YES SIRE REPLIED THE PHYSICIAN I PROMISE MYSELF SUCCESS THROUGH GOD'S ASSISTANCE
IT IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS FOR A MONARCH TO CONFIDE IN A MAN WHOSE FIDELITY HE HAS NEVER TRIED
I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS PHYSICIAN WHOM YOU SUSPECT TO BE A VILLAIN AND A TRAITOR IS ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST VIRTUOUS OF MEN YOU KNOW BY WHAT MEDICINE OR RATHER BY WHAT MIRACLE HE CURED ME OF MY LEPROSY
AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED TO KING SINBAD THAT HE OUGHT TO BEWARE LEST ON THE ACCUSATION OF A MOTHER IN LAW HE SHOULD COMMIT AN ACTION OF WHICH HE MIGHT AFTERWARDS REPENT

LYMAN CASS GAVE CHAMP A WARM BERTH AS NIGHT WATCHMAN
HE WAS WELL BUT STILL WEAK FROM HAVING BEEN GASSED HE HAD BEEN DISCHARGED AND HE CAME HOME AS THE FIRST OF THE WAR VETERANS IT WAS RUMORED THAT HE SURPRISED VIDA BY COMING UNANNOUNCED THAT VIDA FAINTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND FOR A NIGHT AND DAY
THE TOWNSMEN INVITED THEMSELVES TO THE FEAST MILLERS REAL ESTATE MEN LAWYERS MERCHANTS AND DOCTOR WILL KENNICOTT THEY BOUGHT LAND AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOLD IT NEXT DAY AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY AND BOUGHT AGAIN
SHE SPOKE ILL OF HIM AT HOME AND IN PUBLIC PLACES BUT KENNICOTT AND THE OTHER POWERS INSISTED MAYBE HE IS KIND OF A ROUGHNECK
AS SHE FLITTED UP SIXTEENTH STREET AFTER A KREISLER RECITAL GIVEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FOR THE GOVERNMENT CLERKS AS THE LAMPS KINDLED IN SPHERES OF SOFT FIRE AS THE BREEZE FLOWED INTO THE STREET FRESH AS PRAIRIE WINDS AND KINDLIER
THEY WENT TO SUNDAY SERVICE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR MISSIONARY LECTURES CHURCH SUPPERS PRECISELY AS THEY HAD AT HOME THEY AGREED THAT AMBASSADORS AND FLIPPANT NEWSPAPERMEN AND INFIDEL SCIENTISTS OF THE BUREAUS
ABOUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR THE CAPTAIN INTRODUCED HER TO THE SECRETARY OF A CONGRESSMAN A CYNICAL YOUNG WIDOW WITH MANY ACQUAINTANCES IN THE NAVY THROUGH HER CAROL MET COMMANDERS AND MAJORS NEWSPAPERMEN
INDEED HER ONLY RECOGNIZED POSITION WAS AS AN ABLE ADDRESSER OF ENVELOPES BUT SHE WAS CASUALLY ADOPTED BY THIS FAMILY OF FRIENDLY WOMEN WHO WHEN THEY WERE NOT BEING MOBBED OR ARRESTED TOOK DANCING LESSONS OR WENT PICNICKING UP THE CHESAPEAKE CANAL
THE LINES ARE BROKEN AND UNCERTAIN OF DIRECTION OFTEN INSTEAD OF RISING THEY SINK IN WAVERING SCRAWLS AND THE COLORS ARE WATERY BLUE AND PINK AND THE DIM GRAY OF RUBBED PENCIL MARKS A FEW LINES ARE TRACEABLE
DOWN A LITTLE WAY THE TUNNEL GREW SMALLER AND THEN REMAINED THE SAME SIZE ALL THE REST OF THE WAY WAY DOWN AT THE FARTHER END WAS A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM WITH SOME GRASS IN IT THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OTHER LITTLE ROOMS
AND THERE WERE TWO BRANCH TUNNELS LEADING UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND MAKING SIDE OR BACK DOORWAYS THERE WAS NO SAND AROUND EITHER OF THESE AND THEY WERE QUITE HIDDEN BY THE LONG GRASS HANGING OVER THEM
WHAT HE STAMMERED DO YOU MEAN TO KEEP THAT MONEY EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME BUT I OWE THIS MONEY TO THE CHARITY FUND A DEPOSIT WHICH I PROMISED TO PAY THIS MORNING OH WELL THEN SAID MONTE CRISTO
AS IF ONE CROWN WERE NOT AS GOOD AS ANOTHER EXCUSE ME AND HE BEGAN TO LAUGH LOUDLY BUT NERVOUSLY CERTAINLY I EXCUSE YOU SAID MONTE CRISTO GRACIOUSLY AND POCKET THEM AND HE PLACED THE BONDS IN HIS POCKET BOOK BUT
THEY ARE GONE TO SEEK A VERY STRICT CONVENT IN ITALY OR SPAIN
AFTER EXPRESSING ACUTE SYMPATHY WITH THE FATHER
YOU THEREFORE STILL OWE ME FIVE MILLIONS AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS I WILL TAKE THE FIVE SCRAPS OF PAPER THAT I NOW HOLD AS BONDS WITH YOUR SIGNATURE ALONE AND HERE IS A RECEIPT IN FULL FOR THE SIX MILLIONS BETWEEN US
A GREAT SWARM OF TIRED MAGPIE GIRLS FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE CROWDED ALONG WITH SHRIEKS OF STRIDENT LAUGHTER THREE TO AN UMBRELLA A SQUAD OF MARCHING POLICEMEN PASSED ALREADY MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED BY OILSKIN CAPES THE RAIN GAVE AMORY A FEELING OF DETACHMENT
AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
NO I AM MERELY AFRAID OF BEING POOR QUESTION VERY AFRAID
NOT NECESSARILY QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE THE TEST OF CORRUPTION
THEY DON'T THEY JUST WANT THE FUN OF EATING IT ALL OVER AGAIN THE MATRON DOESN'T WANT TO REPEAT HER GIRLHOOD SHE WANTS TO REPEAT HER HONEYMOON
WONDER WHAT HUMBIRD'S BODY LOOKED LIKE NOW IF HE HIMSELF HADN'T BEEN BAYONET INSTRUCTOR HE'D HAVE GONE UP TO LINE THREE MONTHS SOONER PROBABLY BEEN KILLED WHERE'S THE DARNED BELL
YOU SMILE BARBICANE
ASKED BARBICANE HUMPH SAID MICHEL ARDAN IT IS NOT EASY WE ARE IN THE TRAIN AND THE GUARD'S WHISTLE WILL SOUND BEFORE TWENTY FOUR MINUTES ARE OVER TWENTY SAID NICHOLL
WE MIGHT WELL ASK OURSELVES OF WHAT MATERIALS ARE THE HEARTS OF THESE AMERICANS MADE TO WHOM THE APPROACH OF THE MOST FRIGHTFUL DANGER ADDED NO PULSATION
THERE THE THREE TRAVELERS WERE TO STRETCH THEMSELVES SOME MOMENTS BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE DURING THIS TIME ARDAN NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP STILL TURNED IN HIS NARROW PRISON LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE
THE ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT PAYS NEARLY ALL EXPENSES OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF JOURNALISM ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR PRIVATE GAIN ARE PAID AT A REGULAR RATE IT COSTS MORE TO ADVERTISE AT CERTAIN PERIODS THAN AT OTHER TIMES
WHEN AN EXCHANGE OF SEATS IS NECESSARY IT IS ALL DONE SO EASILY AND SO QUICKLY THAT YOU WOULD WONDER WHY WE TOLERATE TROLLEY CARS IN TRAVELING FROM CITY TO CITY A SYSTEM IS IN USE THAT I WILL CALL THE TOBOGGAN SLIDE SYSTEM
PUBLIC HIGHWAYS THESE INTERESTING PEOPLE EXCEL US IN THEIR STYLE AND MANNER OF HOME BUILDING FENCING AND MAKING PUBLIC HIGHWAYS WE ARE HEATHENISH IN OUR PROGRESS ALONG THE LINE OF ROAD MAKING ESPECIALLY
AND THAT HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD LOSE THE THRONE OF CIVIL POWER THAT THEY WOULD BE TESTED FOR A SEASON IN THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AND BY THE FIRES OF TERRIBLE PERSECUTION AND THAT THEY WHO WOULD ENDURE UNTO THE END WOULD BE GLORIFIED
THOUGH IT WAS BALLED IN UPON ITSELF HE WAS SURE THE CREATURE WAS FULLY AS LARGE AS HE AND THE MENACING CLAWS SUGGESTED IT WAS A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT WHEN IT MADE NO MOVE TO FOLLOW HIM
RYNCH BEGAN TO HOPE IT HAD ONLY BEEN DEFENDING ITS OWN HIDING PLACE FOR ITS PRESENT ATTITUDE SUGGESTED CONCEALMENT STILL FACING THAT FEATURELESS BLOB IN THE TREE THE MAN RETREATED ALERT FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF ADVANCE ON THE PART OF THE CREATURE ABOVE
SUPPOSE RYNCH'S VOICE WAS RUSTY SOUNDING IN HIS OWN EARS WE TALK NOW THE MAN NODDED
I WILL GIVE YOU LETTERS TO CONDE AND RECOLLECT THAT WHATEVER GENERAL YOU TAKE SERVICE UNDER YOU WILL FOLLOW HIM WITHOUT PRETENDING TO CALCULATE HOW FAR HIS MOVEMENTS MAY BE RIGHT OR WRONG THAT IS NOT YOUR AFFAIR
HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE INTENDANT THANKING HIM FOR HIS KIND FEELINGS AND INTENTIONS TOWARD HIM AND HE TRUSTED THAT HE MIGHT ONE DAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HIM AGAIN HE DID NOT HOWEVER THINK IT ADVISABLE TO MENTION THE NAME OF HIS DAUGHTER
AFTER THE PEACE AND THE PARDON OF CONDE BY THE FRENCH KING THE ARMIES WERE DISBANDED AND THE THREE ADVENTURERS WERE FREE THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE OF THE PRINCE WHO THANKED THEM FOR THEIR LONG AND MERITORIOUS SERVICES
AND THE KING'S OBLIGATIONS TO THEM ARE MUCH GREATER THAN THEY ARE TO YOU BESIDES MERELY FOR WHAT MAY BE CALLED A POINT OF HONOR FOR IT IS NO MORE IN WHAT AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION WILL YOU PUT HIS MAJESTY
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A DRAWING ROOM WAS TO BE HELD AND EDWARD'S SISTERS WERE TO BE PRESENTED EDWARD WAS STANDING WITH MANY OTHERS OF THE SUIT BEHIND THE CHAIR OF THE KING AMUSING HIMSELF WITH THE PRESENTATIONS AS THEY TOOK PLACE
TELL HIM THAT I HAVE JUST MADE KNOWN TO YOU HIS NOBLE AND DISINTERESTED CONDUCT YOU ARE RIGHT I WILL I FEAR HOWEVER HUMPHREY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT AND EDITH WRONG AS REGARDS HIS DAUGHTER
NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
WELL CHALONER TO ALL APPEARANCE YOUR GOOD AUNTS HAVE DONE JUSTICE TO THEIR CHARGE NATURE HAS DONE MORE EDWARD I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE GROWN INTO SUCH LOVELY GIRLS AS THEY HAVE
ALTHOUGH I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE HANDSOME AS THEY PASSED EDWARD CAUGHT THE EYE OF EDITH AND SMILED ALICE THAT'S EDWARD SAID EDITH SO LOUD AS TO BE HEARD BY THE KING AND ALL NEAR HIM
HE CAN NOT REFUSE IT PUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN PRINCES BROTHER REPLIED ALICE I DOUBT IF THE KING OR HIS COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE TO MAKE SO MANY DISCONTENTED
BUT IF WE WERE TO STRIKE OUT ALL SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCES FROM SOCIAL LIFE WE SHOULD GIVE UP SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF SUGGESTION IS GIVEN WHEREVER MEN COME IN CONTACT IN ITSELF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE GOOD RESOLUTION AND THE BAD ONE CAN BE SUGGESTED
BELONGING THEREFORE ENTIRELY TO THE PURPOSIVE VIEW OF THE MIND BUT WE HAVE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE IT IS OUR DUTY TO DO JUSTICE TO THIS PURPOSIVE VIEW TOO AS LONG AS WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PHYSICIAN
DRAW THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF A NATURALISTIC VIEW OF THE MIND WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER OR NOT SERIOUS INTERESTS IN THE PURPOSIVE SPHERE ARE INJURED IF THERE IS MORAL CRITICISM AGAINST SUGGESTIVE THERAPY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER IT
IS TOO MUCH OVERSHADOWED BY THE DEEP PITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THEIR SUFFERING AND CRAVING DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF SUCCESSIVE TREATMENTS TO MAKE A MAN FIGHT WHERE DESPAIR IS INEVITABLE AND WHERE THE ENEMY IS NECESSARILY STRONGER THAN HIS OWN POWERS CAN CERTAINLY NOT BE THE MORAL DEMAND
BUT THE CONCEPTION OF THE BORN CRIMINAL IS ALSO ONLY A LABEL WHICH IS SUPERFICIALLY USED FOR A GREAT VARIETY OF MINDS THAT MEN ARE BORN WITH A BRAIN WHICH NECESSARILY PRODUCES CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS NOT INDICATED BY ANY FACTS
IF IT IS NOT SUGGESTED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE SUBJECT HIMSELF SCIENCE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS OR EXPERIMENTS WITH ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES ONLY UNDER THE ONE CONDITION THAT A PHYSICIAN HAS HYPNOTIZED THE SUBJECT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS HEALTH
WHAT IS GAINED IF SOME NERVOUS DISORDERS ARE HELPED BY BELIEF IF THE BELIEF ITSELF DEVASTATES OUR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE AND BRINGS THE MASSES DOWN AGAIN TO A VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS ALL THE EARMARKS OF BARBARISM
EVERY FEW HOPS HE WOULD STOP TO THINK BUT ALL HIS STOPPING AND ALL HIS THINKING WERE IN VAIN AND WHEN HE STARTED FOR SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS AS PUZZLED AS EVER
LEFT VAGUE PERPLEXING MEMORIES STRANGE CREATURES STRANGE SCENERY AS IF FROM ANOTHER PLANET THERE WAS A DISTINCT IMPRESSION TOO OF A MOMENTOUS CONVERSATION OF A NAME
HE FELT THE FEATURELESS MISERY OF ONE WHO WAKES TOWARDS THE HOUR OF DAWN HE HAD AN UNCERTAIN SENSE OF WHISPERS AND FOOTSTEPS HASTILY RECEDING
AND WITH A VERY LARGE AND SIMPLE WHITE ARCHWAY FACING HIM CLOSE TO THE WALLS OF THE CAGE WERE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE A TABLE COVERED WITH A SILVERY CLOTH SILVERY LIKE THE SIDE OF A FISH
WERE VAST AND VAGUE ARCHITECTURAL FORMS THE TUMULT OF VOICES ROSE NOW LOUD AND CLEAR AND ON THE BALCONY AND WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM GESTICULATING AND APPARENTLY IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION
HABITUAL SELF POSSESSION AND SELF RESPECT HAPPY AND GRACIOUS WILLINGNESS HARD SOULED AND JOYOUSLY JOYOUS
I AM NOT WITHOUT A LURKING SUSPICION I BEMOANED MY UNLUCKY FATE I COULD ALMOST ALLEGE IT AS A SUPREME EXAMPLE
IMPERILED IN A RESTLESS AGE
IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN A PLATITUDE IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH ELEVATED AND DIGNIFIED CHARACTER IT IS NOT WHOLLY INSIGNIFICANT
IT RUNS COUNTER TO ALL ESTABLISHED CUSTOMS IT WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IT WEARS A RAGGED AND DANGEROUS FRONT
LAID DOWN IN A MOST UNFLINCHING AND VIGOROUS FASHION LAMENTABLE INSTANCES OF EXTRAVAGANCE LASH THEMSELVES INTO FURY
NATURALLY PRONE TO BELIEVE NECESSITY THUS IMPOSED BY PRUDENCE NERVELESS AND FAITHLESS FOLLY
ONE OF LIFE'S IRONICAL ADJUSTMENTS ONE OF THE FORESEEN AND INEVITABLE RESULTS
PITIFUL SHIFTS OF POLICY PLAINLY DICTATED BY A LOFTY PURPOSE
PREDICT THE GLOOMIEST CONSEQUENCES PREGNANT WITH A LESSON OF THE DEEPEST IMPORT PRESENTED WITH MATCHLESS VIGOR AND COURAGE
CHAPTER NINE COUNT FERRALTI
AS THEY ENTERED THE PRETTY CIRCULAR HALL DEVOTED TO THE DANCE LOUISE GAVE A START OF SURPRISE
AND THAT IS RIGHT SIR WAS THE PROMPT REPLY ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU MY CARD UNCLE JOHN TOOK THE CARD AND READ CONTE LEONARDI FERRALTI MILANO ITALIA
HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE CARD IN HIS POCKET BOOK THANK YOU SAID HE IT'S A FINE MORNING COUNT CHARMING MISTER MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WALKED AWAY HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD NOT SUSPECTED THE YOUNG MAN UNJUSTLY
HE WAS TOO YOUNG THEN TO HAVE OPINIONS OF HIS OWN ABOUT PEOPLE BUT AT TIMES IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM NOT TO HAVE VERY DEFINITE OPINIONS ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO WAS HIS MOTHER DAVID WAS ALWAYS A QUIET ORDERLY BOY
HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND TRIED NOT TO THINK OF ANYTHING HE HAD A HABIT OF TALKING ALOUD TO HIMSELF AND EARLY IN LIFE A SPIRIT OF QUIET SADNESS OFTEN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM ON THE OCCASIONS WHEN DAVID WENT TO VISIT HIS GRANDFATHER ON THE BENTLEY FARM
THE DARKNESS ABOUT HIM SEEMED LIMITLESS THE SOUND OF THE WIND BLOWING IN TREES WAS TERRIFYING WHEN A TEAM OF HORSES APPROACHED ALONG THE ROAD IN WHICH HE WALKED HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND CLIMBED A FENCE THROUGH A FIELD HE RAN UNTIL HE CAME
BUT HE NO LONGER DEMANDED SUCH RECOGNITION INSTEAD HE PRAYED FOR IT SOMETIMES HE WAS ALTOGETHER DOUBTFUL AND THOUGHT GOD HAD DESERTED THE WORLD
WHEN HE AWOKE AT DAWN THE BARNYARD BACK OF THE HOUSE ALSO AWOKE IN THE HOUSE PEOPLE STIRRED ABOUT ELIZA STOUGHTON THE HALF WITTED GIRL WAS POKED IN THE RIBS BY A FARM HAND AND GIGGLED NOISILY IN SOME DISTANT FIELD A COW BAWLED AND WAS ANSWERED
IT IS AN ATMOSPHERE NOT CORRUPTED BY MY PRESENCE SHE SAID SHARPLY
ANOTHER BY A SLIGHT CURVE FURROWED THE SEA OF NECTAR BREAKING AGAINST
AGREED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT IS NOT THE MOON HABITABLE FOR CREATURES DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED FROM OURSELVES
NO PRINCE HOWEVER WOULD JUDGE OF A PRINCESS BY WEIGHT THE LOVELINESS OF HER FOOT HE WOULD HARDLY ESTIMATE BY THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION IT COULD MAKE IN MUD PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE IN THE WATER YOU STUPID
BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO PULL ME DOWN OUT OF THE WATER AND THROW ME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR I NEVER DID YOU ANY HARM PARDON ME I DID NOT MEAN TO HURT YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS AND THAT IS A WORSE LOSS THAN YOUR WRETCHED GRAVITY
THAT WOULD HAVE SENT HER ALOFT AGAIN BUT FOR THE HOLD SHE HAD OF HIS ARM PUT ME UP DIRECTLY PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER ALMOST ALREADY
VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
AND AWAY THEY WENT SWIMMING AND DIVING AND FLOATING UNTIL AT LAST THEY HEARD CRIES ALONG THE SHORE AND SAW LIGHTS GLANCING IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NOW QUITE LATE AND THERE WAS NO MOON I MUST GO HOME SAID THE PRINCESS
THE COURTIERS DID NOT RESENT HIS BLUNTNESS EXCEPT BY SAYING TO EACH OTHER THAT HE WAS TAKING IT OUT IN IMPUDENCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO BE PUT IN THE GOLDEN PLATE CONTAINED NO INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT
THE PEOPLE OBEYED HER AND WENT PRESENTLY A LITTLE WAVE FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED ONE OF THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
AND A LONG PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU PRINCE SAID THE PRINCESS AT LAST QUITE COOLLY AS SHE LAY IN THE BOAT WITH HER EYES SHUT I AM SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
AND SHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO FEED HIM WITH BITS OF BISCUIT AND SIPS OF WINE AS SHE FED HIM HE CONTRIVED TO KISS THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS NOW AND THEN SHE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE PRINCE FELT BETTER
ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
ASKED THE OLD MAN WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE STRANGLED MUFTI I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED THE WORTHY MAN AND I HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NAME OF ANY MUFTI NOR OF ANY VIZIER I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
THAT YOUR PRESENTS WOULD SOON BE DISSIPATED AND ONLY MAKE THEM THE MORE MISERABLE YOU HAVE ROLLED IN MILLIONS OF MONEY YOU AND CACAMBO
I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
THE DYING FIRES IN THE CLEARING CAST A DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT ON THE DUSKY FIGURES THAT WERE SILENTLY STALKING TO AND FRO AND OCCASIONALLY A BRIGHTER GLEAM THAN COMMON GLANCED INTO THE LODGE AND EXHIBITED THE FIGURE OF UNCAS
HE HAD NOT LONG OCCUPIED THE SEAT WISELY TAKEN A LITTLE IN THE SHADE WHEN ANOTHER OF THE ELDER WARRIORS WHO SPOKE THE FRENCH LANGUAGE ADDRESSED HIM MY CANADA FATHER DOES NOT FORGET HIS CHILDREN SAID THE CHIEF
IN THE CASES OF SUCH SUPPOSED VISITATIONS HE SAW AT A GLANCE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE IMPROVED TO FURTHER HIS OWN ENDS IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT JUST THEN TO HAVE UTTERED A PROPOSAL
SEVERAL PIPES THAT HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED WERE LIGHTED AGAIN
HE IS HAPPY WHO KNOWS THAT THE EVIL OF HIS RACE DIES WITH HIMSELF I HAVE DONE THE SPEAKER WHO WAS THE FATHER OF THE RECREANT YOUNG INDIAN LOOKED ROUND AND ABOUT HIM
SUFFERED HIM TO DEPART IN SILENCE THEN WITH AN ELEVATION OF BREEDING THAT MANY IN A MORE CULTIVATED STATE OF SOCIETY MIGHT PROFITABLY EMULATE ONE OF THE CHIEFS DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG MEN
ITS NUMBER SOMEWHAT EXCEEDED A THOUSAND SOULS
WHICH THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THIS VENERATED INDIVIDUAL CREATED HAD A LITTLE SUBSIDED
THE AMERICANS SOMETIMES CALLED THEIR TUTELAR SAINT TAMENAY A CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED CHIEF HERE INTRODUCED
AROSE LEFT THE CROWD AND ENTERED THE LODGE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED AS THE OBJECT OF SO MUCH ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THAT MORNING
BUT THE YENGEESE HAVE LONG ARMS AND LEGS THAT NEVER TIRE
EMMA JANE PRACTICED IT ON REBECCA AND REBECCA ON EMMA JANE CAN I SELL YOU A LITTLE SOAP THIS AFTERNOON IT IS CALLED THE SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED SOAP
THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AT EMMA JANE'S HOUSE WHERE REBECCA TO HER UNBOUNDED JOY WAS TO STAY OVER SUNDAY HER AUNTS HAVING GONE TO PORTLAND TO THE FUNERAL OF AN OLD FRIEND
I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID REBECCA CONSCIENTIOUSLY BUT I'LL LOOK IN THE CIRCULAR IT'S SURE TO TELL AND SHE DREW THE DOCUMENT FROM HER POCKET WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE MAGNIFICENT PROFITS YOU GET FROM THIS BUSINESS
OH EXCLAIMED REBECCA SYMPATHETICALLY MINE WAS NO SHOES AND TOO MANY BABIES AND NOT ENOUGH BOOKS BUT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT AND HAPPY NOW AREN'T YOU SHE ASKED DOUBTFULLY FOR THOUGH HE LOOKED HANDSOME WELL FED AND PROSPEROUS
HOW MUCH HAS YOUR AUNT ON HAND NOW SUGGESTED THE VERY MODEST AND INEXPERIENCED AGENT AND HOW MUCH WOULD SHE NEED
WHAT IF YOUR AUNT SHOULDN'T LIKE THE KIND OF SOAP QUERIED REBECCA NERVOUSLY MY AUNT ALWAYS LIKES WHAT I LIKE HE RETURNED MINE DOESN'T EXCLAIMED REBECCA THEN THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR AUNT OR WITH ME LAUGHED REBECCA
WHAT IS YOUR NAME YOUNG LADY REBECCA ROWENA RANDALL SIR WHAT WITH AN AMUSED SMILE BOTH YOUR MOTHER WAS GENEROUS SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO GIVE UP EITHER OF THE NAMES SHE SAYS
ON THANKSGIVING THE LAMP ARRIVED IN A LARGE PACKING BOX AND WAS TAKEN OUT AND SET UP BY SEESAW SIMPSON WHO SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ADMIRE AND RESPECT THE BUSINESS ABILITY OF HIS SISTERS
WE COULDN'T KEEP FROM LAUGHING AFTER WE CAME OUT OF THE TENT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTING ON SUCH A SMALL PLATFORM THAT ELIZA HAD TO RUN ROUND AND ROUND
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN THE POCKET OF THAT NEW DRESS THAT MAKES IT SAG DOWN SO IT'S MY NUTS AND RAISINS FROM DINNER REPLIED REBECCA WHO NEVER SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THE MOST INNOCENT ACTION A SECRET FROM HER AUNT MIRANDA THEY'RE JUST WHAT YOU GAVE ME ON MY PLATE WHY DIDN'T YOU EAT THEM
MURMURED SUSAN SAGACIOUSLY AT THE APPOINTED HOUR REBECCA DRAGGED HERSELF RELUCTANTLY AWAY FROM THE ENCHANTING SCENE
JANE ACCOMPANIED REBECCA INTO THE KITCHEN ALTHOUGH THE FEEBLE GLIMMER WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE FROM THAT DISTANCE DID NOT SEEM TO HER A DAZZLING EXHIBITION SHE TRIED TO BE AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS POSSIBLE REBECCA WHO WAS IT
HE WAS TRYING TO OBEY LOUISE AND AMUSE LITTLE COUSIN BUT HE WAS THINKING ALL THE TIME
TRULY AND HONEST PATTY TURNED IT OVER AND POINTED TO THE INITIALS ON THE END
IS IT LOCKED YES PATTY NODDED BUT MY KEY WILL OPEN IT
SHE WAS AS FLUSTERED AS AN OLD HEN WITH ONE CHICKEN SHE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE CONDUCTOR WITH SO MANY INSTRUCTIONS THAT I KNOW HE FELT LIKE A NEWLY ENGAGED NURSEMAID THE GLEE CLUB MEN RODE IN THE SMOKING CAR
EIGHT OTHERS FOLLOWED HER EXAMPLE AND THRILLED AT THE TOUCH IT WAS CALCULATED TO FIT A FAR LARGER PERSON THAN ANY PRESENT EVEN IRENE MC CULLOUGH FOUND IT BAGGY HE HAD AWFULLY BROAD SHOULDERS SAID ROSALIE STROKING THE SATIN LINING
MISSUS TRENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MISS PATTY WYATT COME TO THE DRAWING ROOM AND I AM TO TAKE THE SUIT CASE DOWN THE GENTLEMAN IS WAITING OH PATTY A GASP WENT AROUND THE ROOM DO YOUR HAIR UP QUICK PRISCILLA CAUGHT PATTY'S TWIN BRAIDS AND WOUND THEM AROUND HER HEAD
AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT THEM THEY TREATED THEM AS WELL AS THEIR POVERTY WOULD PERMIT TOOK OFF THEIR HORSE HAIR SHIFTS WHICH WERE VERY UNEASY TO THEM AND PUT ON THEM OTHERS WHICH THEY GAVE THEM WITH SHOES AND SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR HEADS AND SAVE THEIR HAIR
WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED FOR YOUR VIOLENT AND UNJUST PROCEEDINGS HERE FETNAH CEASED HER COMPLAINTS HER SIGHS AND TEARS PUTTING A STOP TO HER UTTERANCE
I MUST OWN THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HE SAW ME HE PERHAPS DESIGNED TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ME AND CONCEIVED HOPES OF ENGAGING ME TO ADMIT HIS LOVE I GUESSED AT THIS BY THE EAGERNESS WHICH HE SHEWED IN ENTERTAINING ME
PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR CARE TAKEN OF HIM I WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO BE PUT INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR WAY OF MANAGING THE SICK AND AM SENSIBLE OF THE INCAPACITY OF THE PHYSICIANS
THE LADY WHO JUST NOW SPOKE TO YOU WILL ACQUAINT YOU WITH THE REST THEREFORE THINK OF NOTHING BUT RECOVERING YOUR HEALTH I WILL CONTRIBUTE ALL IN MY POWER TOWARDS IT HAVING SPOKE THESE WORDS HE LEFT GANEM TO TAKE HIS REST
WHO BEFORE CAUSED SEARCH TO BE MADE FOR YOU TO TAKE AWAY YOUR LIFE AND WHO IN HIS FURY CAUSED YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR SISTER TO SUFFER A THOUSAND INDIGNITIES DESIRES NOW TO SEE YOU THAT HE MAY REWARD THE RESPECT YOU HAD FOR HIM
AND THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT HE WILL LOAD YOUR FAMILY WITH FAVOURS
HE APPEARED SO IMPATIENT TO SEE THEM THAT THE FAVOURITE COULD NO LONGER DEFER GIVING HIM THE SATISFACTION AND ACCORDINGLY CALLED THEM IN THEY WERE AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR THAT MOMENT THEY ENTERED WENT UP TO GANEM AND EMBRACING HIM IN THEIR TURNS
THE SYNDIC HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WERE SO MOVED AT THE SPECTACLE THAT THEY COULD NOT FORBEAR WEEPING NOR SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRE THE SECRET WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT TOGETHER INTO THEIR HOUSE FOUR PERSONS WHOM FORTUNE HAD SO CRUELLY PERSECUTED
WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE HE COULD FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING IT INTO HER OWN HANDS IT IS ENOUGH FETNAH
WHILST SHE HERSELF LED THEM TO OUR WARM BATH AND GAVE THEM CLEAN LINEN
REST AND THE GOOD MEDICINES HE HAD TAKEN BUT ABOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT SITUATION OF HIS MIND HAD WROUGHT SO GOOD AN EFFECT THAT THE SYNDIC THOUGHT HE MIGHT WITHOUT DANGER SEE HIS MOTHER HIS SISTER AND HIS MISTRESS PROVIDED HE WAS PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM
AS SOON AS GANEM HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH
THE SYNDIC WHO WAS A MAN OF A GOOD TASTE CHOSE SUCH AS WERE VERY HANDSOME AND HAD THEM MADE UP WITH ALL EXPEDITION THEY WERE FINISHED IN THREE DAYS AND GANEM FINDING HIMSELF STRONG ENOUGH PREPARED TO GO ABROAD
GANEM RETURNED NO OTHER ANSWER TO THE VIZIER'S COMPLIMENT THAN BY PROFOUNDLY BOWING HIS HEAD
I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AND DESIRE TO HEAR FROM YOUR OWN MOUTH WHERE YOU FOUND MY FAVOURITE AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR HER GANEM OBEYED
JUST THEN THERE WERE TWO OR THREE RATHER SHARP SQUEAKY NOTES FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TREES THERE CRIED PETER THERE DIDN'T YOU HEAR THAT JENNY WREN
SAID PETER SHE DOESN'T LOOK THE LEAST BIT LIKE HIM THIS WAS QUITE TRUE THERE WAS NO BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR ABOUT MISSUS GROSBEAK SHE WAS DRESSED CHIEFLY IN BROWN AND GRAYISH COLORS WITH A LITTLE BUFF HERE AND THERE AND WITH DARK STREAKS ON HER BREAST
NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SEEN REDCOAT SO CLOSE AT HAND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER PETER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH REDCOAT AND HE HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE REDCOAT HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PETER'S FEET AMONG THE DRY LEAVES
THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE SHE WAS NOT EVEN THE MISTRESS THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
THAT IS A WOMAN THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A FISHWIFE WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER
THENCE AROSE FOR HIS WALL THE FLARING SIGN AND FOR HIS INN THE NAME WHICH IT BORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CABARET OF THE SERGEANT OF WATERLOO HE WAS A LIBERAL A CLASSIC AND A BONAPARTIST
A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THENARDIER BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS INTO IT IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE
AND AT SUCH TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS
SILENT OR TALKATIVE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALWAYS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF SAILORS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SCREW UP THEIR EYES TO GAZE THROUGH MARINE GLASSES THENARDIER WAS A STATESMAN
WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
AND WE AS WELL AS OTHERS MAY CALL THIS GOOD SUCCESS BAY IN THE MORNING THE CAPTAIN SENT A PARTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FUEGIANS WHEN WE CAME WITHIN HAIL
AND THEY SEEM CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE FAMOUS PATAGONIANS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN THEIR ONLY GARMENT CONSISTS OF A MANTLE MADE OF GUANACO SKIN WITH THE WOOL OUTSIDE THIS THEY WEAR JUST THROWN OVER THEIR SHOULDERS LEAVING THEIR PERSONS AS OFTEN EXPOSED AS COVERED
WHICH OF US FOR INSTANCE COULD FOLLOW AN AMERICAN INDIAN THROUGH A SENTENCE OF MORE THAN THREE WORDS ALL SAVAGES APPEAR TO POSSESS TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE THIS POWER OF MIMICRY I WAS TOLD ALMOST IN THE SAME WORDS OF THE SAME LUDICROUS HABIT AMONG THE CAFFRES
HE IMITATED THEIR SCREAMS AS A JOKE AND DESCRIBED THE PARTS OF THEIR BODIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED BEST TO EAT HORRID AS SUCH A DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES MUST BE THE FEARS OF THE OLD WOMEN WHEN HUNGER BEGINS TO PRESS ARE MORE PAINFUL TO THINK OF
THAT I DARE SAY HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE HANDSOMEST MAN IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO AFTER OUR FIRST FEELING OF GRAVE ASTONISHMENT WAS OVER NOTHING COULD BE MORE LUDICROUS THAN THE ODD MIXTURE OF SURPRISE AND IMITATION WHICH THESE SAVAGES EVERY MOMENT EXHIBITED
THOUGH NOT AS I HAVE SAID IN THE DEVIL I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR FUEGIANS WERE MUCH MORE SUPERSTITIOUS THAN SOME OF THE SAILORS FOR AN OLD QUARTERMASTER FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE SUCCESSIVE HEAVY GALES WHICH WE ENCOUNTERED OFF CAPE HORN WERE CAUSED BY OUR HAVING THE FUEGIANS ON BOARD
AND CRAWLING ONWARDS HE PEEPED OVER THE CLIFF AND SAW WILD MAN PICKING HIS BIRDS HE CRAWLED A LITTLE NEARER AND THEN HURLED DOWN A GREAT STONE AND KILLED HIM YORK DECLARED FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS STORMS RAGED AND MUCH RAIN AND SNOW FELL
THE GROUND IS CONCEALED BY A MASS OF SLOWLY PUTREFYING VEGETABLE MATTER WHICH FROM BEING SOAKED WITH WATER YIELDS TO THE FOOT FINDING IT NEARLY HOPELESS TO PUSH MY WAY THROUGH THE WOOD I FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF A MOUNTAIN TORRENT
WERE DECAYED TO THE HEART AND READY TO FALL THE ENTANGLED MASS OF THE THRIVING AND THE FALLEN REMINDED ME OF THE FORESTS WITHIN THE TROPICS YET THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE FOR IN THESE STILL SOLITUDES DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE SEEMED THE PREDOMINANT SPIRIT
AT LENGTH WE REACHED THAT WHICH FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED LIKE A CARPET OF FINE GREEN TURF BUT WHICH TO OUR VEXATION TURNED OUT TO BE A COMPACT MASS OF LITTLE BEECH TREES ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FEET HIGH
AND THE WATERS FLOWED TO THE SEA IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WE OBTAINED A WIDE VIEW OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY TO THE NORTH A SWAMPY MOORLAND EXTENDED
THOUGH THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMED WITH SUCH PORTENTS THEY CARED NOT ABOUT EXPLORING FOR ROBBERS CAVES NOR DIGGING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE PERHAPS INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THEIR BEST QUALITIES THAT THEY SPENT THE GREATER PART OF THEIR TIME STUFFILY INDOORS
WE HAD JUST LEFT IT OUTSIDE AND WERE ALL ON FIRE TO GET BACK TO IT OF COURSE WE DIDN'T WASTE THE REVELATION ON THEM THE FUTILITY OF IMPARTING OUR IDEAS HAD LONG BEEN DEMONSTRATED ONE IN THOUGHT AND PURPOSE LINKED BY THE NECESSITY OF COMBATING ONE HOSTILE FATE
BUT WAS THE MATTER ALLOWED TO END THERE I TROW NOT AGAIN WHEN HAROLD WAS LOCKED UP IN HIS ROOM ALL DAY FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY UPON A NEIGHBOUR'S PIG AN ACTION HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED BEING INDEED ON THE FRIENDLIEST TERMS WITH THE PORKER IN QUESTION
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AWAKENINGS OF THE YEAR THE EARTH STRETCHED HERSELF SMILING IN HER SLEEP AND EVERYTHING LEAPT AND PULSED TO THE STIR OF THE GIANT'S MOVEMENT WITH US IT WAS A WHOLE HOLIDAY THE OCCASION A BIRTHDAY IT MATTERS NOT WHOSE
AND THE AGE OF ACORNS HAVE DISPLACED OUR HARD WON CIVILISATION
AND I'LL RUN ON TO THAT CORNER AND BE A LION
AND PRESENTLY I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH SITTING SOLITARY WITHIN ITS CIRCLE OF ELMS FROM FORTH THE VESTRY WINDOW PROJECTED TWO SMALL LEGS GYRATING HUNGRY FOR FOOTHOLD WITH LARCENY
MAKE ONE KNIT ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER
FOR MISSUS JO CARRIED THEM IN HER POCKET WHEN MISTER BHAER DID NOT HAVE THEM IN HIS AND BOTH TOOK A LOOK AT THEM WHEN THEY SAID THEIR PRAYERS AT NIGHT NOW THE PROFESSOR WAS HEARD HUMMING LIKE A BIG BEE AGAIN AS HE WENT TO HIS CLASSES
WHILE THEY WAIT AND WORK SO HAPPILY LET US SEE HOW OUR OTHER ABSENT BOYS ARE FARING AS THEY TOO WAIT AND WORK AND HOPE FOR BETTER DAYS NAT WAS TOILING STEADILY ALONG THE PATH HE HAD WISELY CHOSEN THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS STREWN WITH FLOWERS
THAT HE WAS CHOSEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER OF HIS MOST PROMISING PUPILS TO JOIN THE MUSICAL SOCIETY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PART IN THE GREAT FESTIVAL IN LONDON THE NEXT JULY HERE WAS NOT ONLY HONOUR FOR THE VIOLINIST BUT HAPPINESS FOR THE MAN AS IT BROUGHT HIM NEARER HOME
HE HAD FOUND THE LITTLE GUIDE BOOK THAT CHRISTIAN CARRIED IN HIS BOSOM AND LOVE PENITENCE AND PRAYER THE THREE SWEET SISTERS HAD GIVEN HIM THE ARMOUR WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO WEAR IT YET AND CHAFED AGAINST IT THOUGH HE FELT ITS VALUE
I'M ONE OF FARMER BROWN'S BEST FRIENDS IF HE DID BUT KNOW IT YOU CAN TALK ALL YOU PLEASE ABOUT THE WONDERFUL EYESIGHT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HAWK FAMILY BUT IF ANY ONE OF THEM HAS BETTER EYESIGHT THAN I HAVE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO IT IS
JENNY CALLED PETER JENNY WREN JENNY WREN NO ONE ANSWERED HIM HE COULD HEAR MISTER WREN SINGING IN ANOTHER TREE BUT HE COULDN'T SEE HIM JENNY JENNY WREN JENNY WREN CALLED PETER AGAIN
JENNY WREN WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD WHILE SHE FLITTED AND HOPPED ABOUT THIS WAY AND THAT WAY IN THAT FUSSY WAY OF HERS GETTING HER BREAKFAST SHE TALKED JENNY COULDN'T KEEP HER TONGUE STILL IF SHE WANTED TO DID YOU FIND ANY OLD CLOTHES OF THE SNAKE FAMILY SHE DEMANDED
IN A HOLE IN A TREE LIKE THE REST OF US SENSIBLE PEOPLE RETORTED JENNY WREN PROMPTLY PETER LOOKED QUITE AS SURPRISED AS HE FELT DOES CRESTY MAKE THE HOLE HE ASKED GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN
THE OLDER IT IS THE BETTER IT SUITS ME BUT THE WOODPECKERS SEEM TO LIKE NEW HOUSES BEST WHICH AS I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US
HIS BACK WAS A MIXTURE OF GRAY BROWN BLACK AND BUFF WHILE HIS BREAST AND UNDER PARTS WERE A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH BUFF IT WAS HIS HEAD THAT MADE HIM LOOK QUEER
THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE THE EXPLORERS AND EARLY SETTLERS FOUND A NATIVE RACE OCCUPYING NEARLY EVERY PORTION OF OUR CONTINENT THESE PEOPLE HAD MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON AND WERE ALL CALLED INDIANS
AT CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHEN SALMON WERE PLENTIFUL EACH TRIBE OR GROUP OF INDIANS ESTABLISHED ITS CAMP NEAR ONE OF THE MANY RAPIDS AND WATERFALLS ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER LARGE NUMBERS OF THE SALMON WERE CAUGHT BY THE USE OF TRAPS
AND THE BUILDING IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED SUCH A HOUSE IS USUALLY OCCUPIED BY A NUMBER OF FAMILIES UPON QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS THERE IS A DWELLING OF THIS KIND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED INDIANS
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY MICE LEFT ON FARMER GREEN'S PLACE IT'S MY OPINION THAT THEY'VE MOVED AWAY MOST OF THEM OR MAYBE OLD ROUGH LEG THE HAWK HAS CAUGHT MORE THAN HIS SHARE
HE MUST HAVE HURRIED OVER HERE FROM THE WOODS HE MUST BE VERY HUNGRY AS SOLOMON OWL RETURNED TO THE OLD OAK HIS COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER LAUGHED SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANTLY MISSED HIM DIDN'T YOU HE INQUIRED YES
HE CAUGHT HIS COUSIN BY HIS TAIL AND HELD ON FIRMLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM ME TILL I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW HE DECLARED HOW CAN I EAT A TREE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE DEMANDED YOU CAN'T
JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SKATING FOR JOHNNIE GREEN ON TOP OF THE BROOK IT MUSTN'T BE SUPPOSED THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE A SWIM WHEN HE WANTED ONE
FOR THE MUSKRATS ALL HAD A WARNING SIGNAL THAT TOLD EVERYBODY WHEN THERE WAS DANGER WHEN ONE OF THEM CAUGHT SIGHT OF PETER MINK HE NEVER FAILED IF HE WAS IN THE WATER TO GIVE A LOUD SLAP UPON THE SURFACE WITH HIS TAIL
OH I WON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR PETER MINK TO DAY HE MUST BE MILES AWAY I'LL STEP RIGHT OUT OF MY TUNNEL AND HAVE MY SWIM WITHOUT TAKING A LOOK SEE FIRST BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS NEVER SO LAZY AS THAT
WHEN I TOUCH WHAT THERE IS OF THE WINGED VICTORY IT REMINDS ME AT FIRST OF A HEADLESS LIMBLESS DREAM THAT FLIES TOWARDS ME IN AN UNRESTFUL SLEEP
AND THEY LEARNED THEIR CUNNING FROM THE WISE HAND OF ANOTHER WHICH ITSELF GUIDED BY IMAGINATION LED ME SAFELY IN PATHS THAT I KNEW NOT
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN DOWN AFTER TEN MILES OF THAT HARD TRAIL DAWN CAME WHILE THEY WOUND OVER THE CREST OF THE RANGE AND WITH THE SUN IN THEIR FACES THEY TOOK THE DOWNGRADE IT WAS WELL INTO THE MORNING BEFORE NASH REACHED LOGAN
WHEN HE SEEN THAT HE WAS ALL LAID OUT TO MAKE A TRIP BY HIMSELF
WELL THIS TENDERFOOT HE LOOKS OVER THE HOSS IN THE CORRAL AND SAYS
AND HIS LIPS TWISTIN BACK THE SAME SMILE HE HAD WHEN HE GOT INTO THE SADDLE BUT PRETTY SOON I S'POSE JO HAD A CHANCE TO FIGURE OUT THAT IT DIDN'T DO HIM NO PARTICULAR HARM TO BE ALONE THE MINUTE HE SEEN THAT HE STOPPED FIGHTIN
GO ON BACK TO SLEEP I'LL CALL YOU AGAIN IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
APPARENTLY THE PLACE WAS A HARMLESS ROOMING HOUSE OF FAIRLY GOOD QUALITY NOT A SIGN OF CAROLINE SMITH APPEARED EVEN DURING THE SECOND DAY
PEERING THROUGH THE SLIT BETWEEN THE DRAWN CURTAINS WHICH SHELTERED HIM FROM BEING OBSERVED AT HIS SPYING WHEN HE CALLED OUT SOFTLY THE SOUND BROUGHT GREGG WITH ONE LONG LEAP OUT OF THE CHAIR WHERE HE WAS SLEEPING TO THE WINDOW THERE COULD BE NO SHADOW OF A DOUBT ABOUT IT
SNATCHED HIS HAT AND PLUNGED THROUGH THE DOOR AND RONICKY HEARD THE BRIEF THUNDER OF HIS FEET DOWN THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS THEN THE HEAVY THUMPS AS HE RACED AROUND THE LANDING
THE GIRL HESITATED A MOMENT
NOT YOU BILL YOU'RE GOING TO BUCK UP AND GO AHEAD FULL STEAM
YOU'D MURDER ME IF I TOOK ANOTHER STEP ASKED THE MAN OF THE SNEER AND A CONTEMPTUOUS AND SARDONIC EXPRESSION FLITTED ACROSS HIS FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME I'D SURE BLOW YOU FULL OF LEAD SAID RONICKY FERVENTLY
THE MAN GROWLED SOME RETORT AND LEFT CLOSING THE DOOR HEAVILY BEHIND HIM WHILE RONICKY DOONE BREATHED FREELY AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW SAID THE MAN OF THE SNEER TELL ME THE WHOLE OF IT RUTH RONICKY SET HIS TEETH
I CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR GOOD TASTE A REGULAR APOLLO MY DEAR RUTH HE TURNED BACK TO RONICKY DOONE AND I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE OVERHEAD OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION THE WHOLE LOT OF IT SAID RONICKY
RELIEF WONDER AND EVEN A GLEAM OF OUTRIGHT HAPPINESS SHOT INTO THE EYES OF JOHN MARK CAROLINE YOU CAME FOR THAT SUDDENLY HE LAUGHED HEARTILY BUT THERE WAS A TREMOR OF EMOTION IN THAT LAUGHTER
THE GUN PARTNER AND IF YOU COULDN'T GET THE GIRL BUT SEE HOW ABSURD THE WHOLE THING IS RONICKY DOONE I SEND FOR THE GIRL I REQUEST HER TO GO DOWN WITH YOU TO THE STREET AND TAKE A WALK BECAUSE YOU WISH TO TALK TO HER
SUPPOSE WE SHAKE HANDS TO BIND THE BARGAIN SAID RONICKY YOU SEND FOR CAROLINE SMITH I'M TO DO THE PERSUADING TO GET HER OUT OF THE HOUSE WE'RE SAFE TO THE DOORS OF THE HOUSE THE MINUTE WE STEP INTO THE STREET
IF YOU WOULD HELP YOURSELVES ONE OF YOU MUST GO INTO THE WOOD AND THERE HE WILL COME UPON A TUMBLE DOWN BUILDING OF ROCKS WHICH LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE HOUSE HE MUST GO IN AND THERE HE WILL FIND HELP THE TWO MELANCHOLY ONES THOUGHT
THAT WON'T SAVE US AND THEY REMAINED WHERE THEY WERE BUT THE THIRD AND MERRY ONE JUMPED UP AND WENT INTO THE WOOD TILL HE FOUND THE ROCK HUT IN THE HUT SAT A VERY OLD WOMAN WHO WAS THE DRAGON'S GRANDMOTHER
THE POOR YOUNG COUPLE WERE IN DESPAIR AND ONLY PARTED WITH THE LAST RAY OF SUNSHINE AND IN HOPES OF MEETING NEXT MORNING ALAS NEXT DAY WAS DARK AND GLOOMY AND IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS FOR A FEW MINUTES
AND EATING ANY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HEROINE OBEYED WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER LOVER
SHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED STARS IN THE CEILING
AND AGAIN SHE LED HIM TO THE BALL ROOM THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM SAFE AND SOUND AND WHEN THEY WERE DANCING TOGETHER SHE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR IF YOU SUCCEED AGAIN TO MORROW WAIT FOR ME WITH THE FOAL IN THE MEADOW
NORTHANGER ABBEY
CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
AND THANKFUL FOR MISTER THORPE'S COMMUNICATION HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST HOPES
AND HE KNEW THE YOUNG MAN ON WHOM THE FULLERTON ESTATE MUST DEVOLVE THE GENERAL NEEDED NO MORE ENRAGED WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF HE SET OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR THE ABBEY WHERE HIS PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN SEEN
FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
WITH SEVERAL OF THE IMAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROJECTED ON SUCH A FIELD WE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED
SHE HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND BEHIND HER BUT HAD BROUGHT HER CHILDREN TO WHOM ISABEL NOW PLAYED WITH EQUAL MUNIFICENCE AND TENDERNESS THE PART OF MAIDEN AUNT MISTER LUDLOW
ISABEL HAD DEVELOPED LESS HOWEVER THAN LILY HAD THOUGHT LIKELY DEVELOPMENT TO LILY'S UNDERSTANDING BEING SOMEHOW MYSTERIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH MORNING CALLS AND EVENING PARTIES INTELLECTUALLY DOUBTLESS SHE HAD MADE IMMENSE STRIDES
SET HER RIGHT AGAIN SHE WAS SO FOND OF THE SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE THAT SHE ENJOYED EVEN THE ASPECT OF GATHERING DUSK IN THE LONDON STREETS THE MOVING CROWDS THE HURRYING CABS THE LIGHTED SHOPS THE FLARING STALLS THE DARK
BUT SHE ADDED THAT SHE HERSELF HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSUMED WITH THE DESIRE TO VISIT ATHENS AND CONSTANTINOPLE THE TWO LADIES ACCORDINGLY EMBARKED ON THIS EXPEDITION AND SPENT THREE MONTHS IN GREECE IN TURKEY IN EGYPT
SHE SEEMED INDIFFERENT TO HER POSSESSIONS WAS NOT HALF SO SOLICITOUS ABOUT THEM AS HER FRIENDS WERE SHE WAS TALL DARK SEVERE WITH SOMETHING INDIAN LIKE IN THE RIGID IMMOBILITY OF HER FACE HER MANNER WAS COLD AND SHE TALKED LITTLE
HE SEEMED TO KNOW THAT IT MUST BE DONE WITH THE FINGERS NOT WITH THE FISTS OR THE FEET HE APPROACHED THIS HIGHLY ARTIFICIAL INSTRUMENT THROUGH A MERE INSTINCT AND COUPLED HIMSELF TO IT AS IF HE KNEW IT WAS TO PIECE HIM OUT AND MAKE A WHOLE CREATURE OF HIM
THAT LAY UNDER THE BONES OF HIS PINCHED CONICAL LITTLE SKULL DEFINITE AS ANIMAL DESIRES THE DOOR OPENED MISS NELLIE AND HER MUSIC MASTER STOOD BEHIND IT BUT BLIND SAMSON WHO WAS SO SENSITIVE TO PRESENCES DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE THERE
SHE LOOKED BOLD AND RESOURCEFUL AND UNSCRUPULOUS AND SHE WAS ALL OF THESE THEY WERE HANDSOME GIRLS HAD THE FRESH COLOR OF THEIR COUNTRY UP BRINGING AND IN THEIR EYES THAT BRILLIANCY WHICH IS CALLED BY NO METAPHOR ALAS
IF THE STORY ONCE GOT ABROAD I WOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT I COULD WELL IMAGINE WHAT THE OLD MEN DOWN AT THE DRUG STORE WOULD DO WITH SUCH A THEME
AND HAD LEFT AGAIN ON THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR DENVER THAT MORNING THE AGENT SAID HIS FACE WAS STRIPED WITH COURT PLASTER AND HE CARRIED HIS LEFT HAND IN A SLING HE LOOKED SO USED UP THAT THE AGENT ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE TEN O'CLOCK THE NIGHT BEFORE
MY OWN GARMENTS HAD BEEN TREATED SO BADLY THAT I NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN GRANDMOTHER BURNED THEM IN THE CUTTERS KITCHEN RANGE WHILE ANTONIA WAS PACKING HER TRUNK AND PUTTING HER ROOM IN ORDER TO LEAVE IT THE FRONT DOOR BELL RANG VIOLENTLY
ANTONIA WAS FRIGHTENED AND WAS GOING HOME TO STAY FOR A WHILE SHE TOLD MISSUS CUTTER IT WOULD BE USELESS TO INTERROGATE THE GIRL FOR SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEN MISSUS CUTTER TOLD HER STORY
AND WHEN CLEAR OF CONFINING RAILS SPREAD ON ALL SIDES OVER THE DECK FLOWED FORWARD AND AFT OVERFLOWED DOWN THE YAWNING HATCHWAYS FILLED THE INNER RECESSES OF THE SHIP LIKE WATER FILLING A CISTERN
COMING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EAST AFTER TREADING THE JUNGLE PATHS DESCENDING THE RIVERS COASTING IN PRAUS ALONG THE SHALLOWS CROSSING IN SMALL CANOES FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND PASSING THROUGH SUFFERING
AND ON THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS THE STEAMER POUNDED IN THE DUSK THE CALM WATER OF THE STRAIT AND FAR ASTERN OF THE PILGRIM SHIP A SCREW PILE LIGHTHOUSE PLANTED BY UNBELIEVERS ON A TREACHEROUS SHOAL SEEMED TO WINK AT HER
PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
HIS VOICE SOUNDED REASONABLE SUPPOSE I HAD NOT I MEAN TO SAY SUPPOSE I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP WELL HOW MUCH LONGER SAY A MINUTE HALF A MINUTE
OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SORT WHOSE APPEARANCE CLAIMS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THESE ILLUSIONS YOU HAD THOUGHT GONE OUT EXTINCT COLD AND WHICH AS IF REKINDLED AT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FLAME
THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
HEAVY PROD GETS HOME THE BOND IS FOUND TO BE CLOSE THAT BESIDES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CRAFT THERE IS FELT THE STRENGTH OF A WIDER FEELING THE FEELING THAT BINDS A MAN TO A CHILD HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME BELIEVING THAT
AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
BY WHICH HIS DIM BLURRED SIGHT OF MEN AS TREES WALKING HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR CLEAR OUTLINE AND EFFULGENT DAY THE GROWTH OF HIGHER FEELING WITHIN US IS LIKE THE GROWTH OF FACULTY
OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS
COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
THE PRICKLY STAR CREEPS ON WITH FULL DECEIT TO FORCE THE OYSTER FROM HIS CLOSE RETREAT WHEN GAPING LIDS THEIR WIDEN'D VOID DISPLAY THE WATCHFUL STAR THRUSTS IN A POINTED RAY OF ALL ITS TREASURES SPOILS THE RIFLED CASE
PRAWN SOUP
RUB THEM THROUGH A TAMMY AND MIX THEM BY DEGREES WITH THE SOUP ADD KETCHUP OR ANCHOVY SAUCE TO TASTE WITH A LITTLE LEMON JUICE WHEN IT IS WELL COOKED PUT IN A FEW PICKED PRAWNS LET THEM GET THOROUGHLY HOT AND SERVE
IF MADE WITH WATER SEASONABLE AT ANY TIME SUFFICIENT FOR EIGHT PERSONS NOTE THIS CAN BE THICKENED WITH TOMATOES AND VERMICELLI SERVED IN IT
THIS LITTLE FISH BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE SHRIMP BUT IS NEITHER SO COMMON NOR SO SMALL
WAS THE SECOND SHOCK OF THE EVENING IT WAS AS THOUGH SHE HAD KNOWN IT ALL ALONG HE WAS ON HIS KNEES BY HER SIDE AND HIS ARM WAS ABOUT HER SHOULDERS EVEN BEFORE HIS BRAIN HAD WILLED THE ACT MY GIRL MY GIRL HE SAID GENTLY WON'T YOU PLEASE TELL ME
I AM AFRAID OH I AM AFRAID HE CRUSHED HER IN HIS ARMS HIS CHEEK AGAINST HERS HIS LIPS TINGLING WITH THE CARESS OF HER HAIR BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF NOTHING HE SAID EAGERLY IF YOU WERE AS GUILTY AS HELL I WOULD SAVE YOU
THERE WAS A MAN STANDING IN THE DOORWAY IN THE ACT OF CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM MILBURGH HE SAID BETWEEN HIS TEETH MILBURGH SMILED THE OTHER MOCKINGLY I AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT THIS BEAUTIFUL SCENE
AND PULLED FROM HIS POCKET A CHAIN AT THE END OF WHICH DANGLED A SMALL BUNCH OF KEYS HERE IS THE KEY HE SAID UNLOCK AND READ TO NIGHT TARLING TOOK THE KEY IN HIS HAND INSERTED IT IN FIRST ONE TINY LOCK AND THEN IN THE OTHER
THE CATCHES SNAPPED OPEN AND HE THREW BACK THE FLAP THEN A HAND SNATCHED THE PORTFOLIO FROM HIM AND HE TURNED TO SEE THE GIRL'S QUIVERING FACE AND READ THE TERROR IN HER EYES NO NO SHE CRIED ALMOST BESIDE HERSELF NO FOR GOD'S SAKE NO
PERHAPS MORE SILENT THAN SHE HAD BEEN A YEAR AGO AND SHE DID NOT ATTEND SO BRISKLY TO WHAT WAS PASSING AROUND HER SHE WAS RATHER THINNER AND PALER BUT WHATEVER CHANGE THERE WAS IN HER WAS ALWAYS AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHILIP'S EYES
SHE DIED IN A SIX MONTH SAID WILLIAM SHE FORGIVED HIM BUT IT'S BEYOND ME I THOUGHT IT WERE HIM WHEN I HEERD OF T WORK ABOUT DARLEY KINRAID AND COMING FRA NEWCASSEL WHERE ANNIE LIVED PRENTICE AND I MADE INQUIRY
HE HAD ONLY COME THAT AFTERNOON TO MONKSHAVEN AND FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SEEING SYLVIA ONCE MORE BEFORE HE WENT TO FULFIL HIS ENGAGEMENT AS SPECKSIONEER IN THE URANIA A WHALING VESSEL THAT WAS TO SAIL FROM NORTH SHIELDS ON THURSDAY MORNING AND THIS WAS MONDAY
AND SO DID HE AND WHEN THEY ROSE UP HE HAD FAST HOLD OF HER HAND AND HER FACE WAS TURNED AWAY HALF READY TO CRY
TILL I'D TAUGHT HER TO LOVE ME MORE BUT IF SHE'S A COLD HEART AND CANNOT CARE FOR A HONEST SAILOR WHY THEN I'D BEST GO BACK AT ONCE HE MADE FOR THE DOOR HE MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY SURE FROM SOME SIGN OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT IT TO HER WOMANLY PRIDE TO GIVE WAY
HE HAD INTENDED IF NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS WISHES AND DESIRES WITH REGARD TO SYLVIA TO HER PARENTS BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS HE WAS NOT SORRY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
BUT TO WHOM THEY HAD LATTERLY ADVANCED MONEY THE LETTERS HINTED AT THE UTTER INSOLVENCY OF THIS MANUFACTURER THEY HAD URGED THEIR CORRESPONDENT TO GIVE THEM HIS NAME IN CONFIDENCE AND THIS MORNING'S LETTER HAD BROUGHT IT
OF NOT SEEING HER FOR A WEEK A FORTNIGHT NAY HE MIGHT BE AWAY FOR A MONTH FOR NO RASH HURRY WAS TO MAR HIS DELICATE NEGOTIATION GNAWED AT HIS HEART
PENITENTLY AS IF ANXIOUS TO BE FORGIVEN SYLVIA DID NOT WANT HIS PENITENCE DID NOT CARE FOR HER RIBBON WAS TROUBLED BY HIS EARNESTNESS OF MANNER BUT HE KNEW NOTHING OF ALL THAT HE ONLY KNEW
AND I'LL BE HOME AGAIN AS SOON AS IVER I CAN IN HALF A YEAR SUCH AS HE FORGETS IF IVER HE'S THOUGHT SERIOUS ABOUT HER BUT IN A MY LIFETIME IF I LIVE TO FOURSCORE I CAN NIVER FORGET
I'LL RECKON TO HEAR FRO THEE IN A WEEK OR MAYHAP LESS
HAD NOT THE JEWS PREVENTED IT IF THOU LET THIS MAN GO THOU ART NOT CAESAR'S FRIEND THEY CRIED
THEY ALLOWED THE JEWISH TEACHERS TO CONTINUE THE SYNAGOGUE SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF PALESTINE AND TO TEACH IN THEIR COLLEGES THE MOST FAMOUS JEWISH COLLEGE OF THESE DAYS WAS AT TIBERIUS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA OF GALILEE
HOW TEDIOUS AND MEANINGLESS SUCH INFORMATION APPEARS OF WHAT VALUE WERE ALL THESE DETAILS TO SPEND ALL HIS DAYS IN LEARNING SUCH THINGS AS THESE COULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON A MAN'S CHARACTER NOR MAKE HIM A POWER FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD
CHAPTER ONE UNCLE JOHN'S FARM HOW DID I HAPPEN TO OWN A FARM ASKED UNCLE JOHN INTERRUPTING HIS SOUP LONG ENOUGH TO FIX AN INQUIRING GLANCE UPON MAJOR DOYLE WHO SAT OPPOSITE
ASSERTED THE OTHER HE'S ASSISTED THREE OR FOUR SCORE YOUNG MEN TO START IN BUSINESS IN THE LAST YEAR TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE BY LENDING THEM SUMS RANGING FROM ONE TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
AND HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER THEY'RE DESARVING OR NOT RETORTED MAJOR DOYLE FIERCELY DO YE WANT ME TO BECOME A SLEUTH OR ENGAGE DETECTIVES TO TRACK THE OBJECTS OF YOUR ERRONEOUS PHILANTHROPY
QUERIED THE MAJOR YOU MANE ALL MY THROUBLE WELL AND YOUR MONEY
HE WANTED CAPITAL TO PATENT THE PUMP AND PUT IT ON THE MARKET THE THING LOOKED PRETTY GOOD JOHN SO I LENT HIM A THOUSAND OF YOUR MONEY QUITE RIGHT RETURNED UNCLE JOHN NODDING BUT PRETTY SOON HE CAME BACK WITH A SAD TALE
AN OCCUPATION THAT PROMISED TO BE THRILLING AND DELIGHTFUL WARNED HOWEVER BY THE REBUFF SHE HAD MET WITH FROM UNCLE JOHN THE GIRL DECIDED NOT TO CONFIDE EITHER HER SUSPICIONS OR HER PROPOSED INVESTIGATION TO ANYONE FOR THE PRESENT
AND WARRANT AN EFFORT TO UNTANGLE THE MYSTERY AND AS INSTRUMENTS TO THE END THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE AVAILABLE WHO COULD BE OF USE TO HER MC NUTT THE AGENT WHO EVIDENTLY KNEW MORE THAN HE HAD CARED TO TELL OLD HUCKS AND HIS WIFE
WHEN PATSY AND BETH WILL BE ABLE TO MEET HER THAT'S A GOOD IDEA LOUISE I WAS WONDERING WHAT I'D DO THIS MORNING TELL OLD HUCKS TO GET THE NAG HARNESSED THE GIRL RAN EAGERLY UPON HER ERRAND
DAN GROANED AND AMBLED SLOWLY AROUND TO WHERE UNCLE JOHN STOOD AWAITING HIS NIECE
MERRY ANDREW PANTALOON AND CLOWN PERSISTED IN THE GOOD HUMOR OF THAT WINTER OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE PARIS HAD DISGUISED ITSELF AS VENICE SUCH SHROVE TUESDAYS ARE NO LONGER TO BE SEEN NOW A DAYS
ANY ONE IN THESE VEHICLES IS AT ONCE A SPECTATOR AND A SPECTACLE POLICE SERGEANTS MAINTAINED ON THE SIDES OF THE BOULEVARD THESE TWO INTERMINABLE PARALLEL FILES MOVING IN CONTRARY DIRECTIONS AND SAW TO IT THAT NOTHING INTERFERED WITH THAT DOUBLE CURRENT
THE POPULACE HAS THE MERRY ANDREW PARIS IS A GREAT MAD CITY ON EVERY OCCASION THAT IT IS A GREAT SUBLIME CITY THERE THE CARNIVAL FORMS PART OF POLITICS PARIS LET US CONFESS IT WILLINGLY ALLOWS INFAMY TO FURNISH IT WITH COMEDY
CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE WEDDING CARRIAGE CONTAINING THE BRIDAL PARTY OPPOSITE THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD HULLO SAID A MASKER HERE'S A WEDDING A SHAM WEDDING RETORTED ANOTHER WE ARE THE GENUINE ARTICLE AND BEING TOO FAR OFF TO ACCOST THE WEDDING PARTY
THE FIRST INSPECTOR WHO GETS HIS EYE ON ME WILL ARREST ME YOU KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH YES I DO I'M BOUGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR TO DAY ALL THE SAME THAT OLD FELLOW BOTHERS ME DO THE OLD FELLOWS BOTHER YOU BUT YOU'RE NOT A YOUNG GIRL
HAUGHTY WITH HEAD HELD HIGH AMALGAMATING MORE THAN EVER IN HIS TOILET AND HIS MANNERS ALL THE ELEGANCES OF THE EPOCH OF BARRAS ESCORTED COSETTE
THE ARM CHAIR BEING OCCUPIED M FAUCHELEVENT WAS OBLITERATED AND NOTHING WAS LACKING AND FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARD THE WHOLE TABLE FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER WAS LAUGHING WITH ALL THE ANIMATION OF FORGETFULNESS AT DESSERT
THIS EVENING YOU SHALL HAVE ONE FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER LISTEN TO ME I WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF ADVICE ADORE EACH OTHER I DO NOT MAKE A PACK OF GYRATIONS I GO STRAIGHT TO THE MARK BE HAPPY IN ALL CREATION
LET US BE HAPPY WITHOUT QUIBBLING AND QUIRKING LET US OBEY THE SUN BLINDLY WHAT IS THE SUN IT IS LOVE HE WHO SAYS LOVE SAYS WOMAN AH AH BEHOLD OMNIPOTENCE WOMEN
THERE HAS BEEN THE IMPERIAL SCEPTRE SURMOUNTED BY A GLOBE THERE HAS BEEN THE SCEPTRE OF CHARLEMAGNE WHICH WAS OF IRON THERE HAS BEEN THE SCEPTRE OF LOUIS THE GREAT WHICH WAS OF GOLD THE REVOLUTION TWISTED THEM BETWEEN ITS THUMB AND FOREFINGER
I TOO HAVE HAD MY DREAM I TOO HAVE MEDITATED I TOO HAVE SIGHED I TOO HAVE HAD A MOONLIGHT SOUL LOVE IS A CHILD SIX THOUSAND YEARS OLD LOVE HAS THE RIGHT TO A LONG WHITE BEARD
M FAUCHELEVENT TOLD ME TO SAY TO YOU SIR THAT HE WAS SUFFERING HIS INJURED HAND WAS PAINING HIM SOMEWHAT AND THAT HE COULD NOT DINE WITH MONSIEUR LE BARON
THEREFORE THE IDEA OF EVERY MODE IN WHICH THE HUMAN BODY IS AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES INVOLVES THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF THE EXTERNAL BODY
WILL REGARD THE EXTERNAL BODY AS ACTUALLY EXISTING
THE HUMAN BODY ITSELF AND AS ACTUALLY EXISTING THEREFORE THE MIND PERCEIVES THUS FAR ONLY THE HUMAN BODY
AND HITHERTO IN THIS LAND OF THE WEST MOST COUPLES IN LOVE HAVE THOUGHT IT BEST TO FOLLOW THE ANCIENT WAY OF THE REST
BUT SLOWLY OUR PRINCESS YIELDED A DIAMOND NECKLACE CAUGHT HER EYE
WE COMMONERS STOOD BY THE STREET FACADE AND CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE CAVALCADE
THAT TOLD AS PLAINLY AS WORDS COULD SPEAK SHE WAS MORE ANTIQUE THAN THE OTHER LEANED ON THE ARM OF DON RATAPLAN SANTA CLAUS DE LA MUSCOVADO SENOR GRANDISSIMO BASTINADO HAPPY MORTAL FORTUNATE MAN AND MARQUIS OF EL DORADO
WHO CALICO WEAR EACH MORN OF THEIR LIVES AND THE SEWING GIRLS AND LES CHIFFONNIERS IN RAGS AND HUNGER A GAUNT ARRAY AND ALL THE GROOMS OF THE CARAVAN
THE WOMAN WHO MARRIED AN OWL BY ANNE VIRGINIA CULBERTSON WHEN THE CHILDREN GOT HOME FROM THE NUTTING EXPEDITION AND HAD EATEN SUPPER THEY SAT AROUND DISCONTENTEDLY WISHING EVERY FEW MINUTES THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD RETURNED I WISH MAMMA WOULD COME BACK
DEY ALL MADE DER BRE'KFUS OFFEN ROAS'IN' YEARS ER DE NEW CAWN AN DEN DE DARNSE BEGUN AN LASTED FO DAYS AN FO NIGHTS
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THE PRICE BY THIS TIME ANSWERED THE OLD LADY IN THE PETTICOAT
INDEED AFTER WHAT MISTER SOWERBY HAD SAID AND AFTER LORD LUFTON'S ASSENT TO IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS HE CONSIDERED TO DECLINE IT AND THEN TOO MISTER SOWERBY'S PROMISE ABOUT THE BILLS WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO HIM AFTER ALL
AND THAT THE PURCHASING OF A HUNTER WITH THE VIEW OF IMMEDIATELY SELLING HIM AGAIN WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT AN OPERATION HARDLY CONGENIAL WITH THE USUAL TASTES AND PURSUITS OF A CLERGYMAN I HOPE YOU DID NOT GIVE VERY MUCH MONEY FOR HIM MARK SAID FANNY
SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
THAT HER LOVE DID CLING TO HIM SHE KNEW EVEN THEN AND OWNED MORE THOROUGHLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE SO MUCH HER PRIDE HAD DONE FOR HER AND THAT STRONG RESOLVE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD NOT SCOWL ON HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE HAD ENTRAPPED HER SON
THE PONY CARRIAGE IS WRETCHED FOR THREE OH AS FOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE NEW HORSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY YOU AS FAR AS THAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO SEE MISTER CRAWLEY SO I DO AND THE NEW HORSE AS YOU CALL HIM SHALL CARRY ME THERE TO MORROW
AS TO MAKE HER SISTER IN LAW QUITE SURE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LOVE PASSAGES UP TO THAT TIME AND NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED WHICH HAD CREATED ANY SUSPICION IN MISSUS ROBARTS MIND SHE HAD SEEN AT ONCE THAT ALL THE CLOSE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WAS OVER AND THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
OH BY GOD'S MERCY VERY LITTLE AS FOR ME I SHALL GET OVER IT IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS I DON'T DOUBT THAT'S IF I CAN GET ASS'S MILK AND CHANGE OF AIR WE'LL TAKE YOU TO BARCHESTER FOR THAT BUT AS I WAS SAYING I REALLY DO THINK LORD LUFTON LIKES GRISELDA GRANTLY
AND THE SCANTY COMFORT OF THEIR IMPROVED THOUGH STILL WRETCHED INCOME HAD DONE SOMETHING TOWARDS BRINGING HER BACK TO THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LIVED IN THE SOFT DAYS OF HER CHILDHOOD BUT EVEN THE LIBERAL STIPEND OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
AS REGARDS THE MERE EATING AND DRINKING THE AMOUNTS OF BUTCHER'S MEAT AND TEA AND BUTTER THEY OF COURSE WERE USED IN QUANTITIES WHICH ANY ARTISAN WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS COMPATIBLE ONLY WITH DEMI STARVATION BETTER CLOTHING FOR HER CHILDREN WAS NECESSARY AND BETTER CLOTHING FOR HIM
LUCY HAD NEVER SEEN MISSUS CRAWLEY THESE VISITS TO HOGGLESTOCK WERE NOT FREQUENT AND HAD GENERALLY BEEN MADE BY LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ROBARTS TOGETHER
AND SHE KNOWS AN ODE OF HORACE ALL BY HEART SAID BOB AN ODE OF HORACE SAID LUCY STILL HOLDING THE YOUNG SHAMEFACED FEMALE PRODIGY CLOSE TO HER KNEES IT IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE THEM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY APOLOGETICALLY
YES I HAVE HEARD OF IT SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GRAVELY I HOPE THAT HIS PROMOTION MAY TEND IN EVERY WAY TO HIS ADVANTAGE HERE AND HEREAFTER IT SEEMED HOWEVER TO BE MANIFEST FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIS KIND WISHES
BUT OUR CHILDREN ARE HARDLY USED TO SUCH THINGS
BUT THE MUFF LAY IN HER LAP PONDEROUS WITH ITS RICH ENCLOSURES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE IN BARCHESTER FOR A PORTION OF THE YEAR NOW SAID MISTER CRAWLEY I REALLY DO NOT KNOW AS YET MARK TALKS OF TAKING LODGINGS FOR HIS FIRST MONTH'S RESIDENCE
BUT THERE ARE MEN MADE OF SUCH STUFF THAT AN ANGEL COULD HARDLY LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT SOME DECEIT PAPA'S GONE NOW WHISPERED BOBBY I SAW HIM TURN ROUND THE CORNER HE AT ANY RATE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON AS IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD DO
TO FEEL HERSELF SO DIFFERENT FROM THE WIVES OF OTHER CLERGYMEN AROUND HER TO KNOW THAT THEY LIVED SOFTLY WHILE SHE WITH ALL THE WORK OF HER HANDS AND UNCEASING STRUGGLE OF HER ENERGIES COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO PLACE WHOLESOME FOOD BEFORE HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING A GRIEVOUS THING TO THINK OF
THAT HE WOULD BE BETTER FITTED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS OWN DUTIES BUT HE ANSWERS ME ANGRILY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HIS COAT IS NOT FIT FOR THE DEAN'S TABLE AND MISSUS CRAWLEY ALMOST BLUSHED AS SHE SPOKE OF SUCH A REASON WHAT WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE DOCTOR ARABIN
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE HERO IN A FAMILY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANOTHER SAID MISSUS ROBARTS OF ALL MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE MISSUS CRAWLEY I THINK COMES NEAREST TO HEROISM AND THEN THEY PASSED BY THE HOGGLESTOCK SCHOOL AND MISTER CRAWLEY WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS CAME OUT
HE DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION HE IS A MAN WHO DOES GOOD BY GUN SHOTS SAID COMBEFERRE THOSE WHO HAVE PRESERVED SOME MEMORY OF THIS ALREADY DISTANT EPOCH KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM THE SUBURBS WAS VALIANT AGAINST INSURRECTIONS
IT WAS SOCIAL ELEMENTS ENTERING INTO STRIFE WHILE AWAITING THE DAY WHEN THEY SHOULD ENTER INTO EQUILIBRIUM ANOTHER SIGN OF THE TIMES WAS THE ANARCHY MINGLED WITH GOVERNMENTALISM THE BARBAROUS NAME OF THE CORRECT PARTY
SUCH AND SUCH NATIONAL GUARDSMEN FOUGHT FOR AN IDEA AND ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AT CRITICAL MOMENTS ON DAYS THEY TOOK COUNSEL LESS OF THEIR LEADERS THAN OF THEIR INSTINCTS
THEY SHOUTED THERE'S ANOTHER OF THOSE SAINT SIMONIANS AND THEY WANTED TO KILL HIM NOW HE HAD UNDER HIS ARM A VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE DUC DE SAINT SIMON
HE COMMANDED MEN AS RESOLUTE AS HIMSELF RAGING FELLOWS AS A WITNESS SAID HIS COMPANY THE SAME WHICH HAD SHOT JEAN PROUVAIRE THE POET WAS THE FIRST OF THE BATTALION POSTED AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET
THUS THEY ARE STRUGGLES OF ONE AGAINST A HUNDRED WHICH ALWAYS END IN CRUSHING THE BARRICADE UNLESS THE REVOLUTION UPRISING SUDDENLY FLINGS INTO THE BALANCE ITS FLAMING ARCHANGEL'S SWORD THIS DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
THIS REPRESSION WAS NOT EFFECTED WITHOUT SOME COMMOTION AND WITHOUT THAT TUMULTUOUS UPROAR PECULIAR TO COLLISIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE
CHAPTER FOURTEEN WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS MISTRESS
BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN DO NOT TREMBLE SO IT IS IMPATIENCE PARRY COME WHAT DID THE GENERAL SAY TO YOU AT FIRST THE GENERAL WOULD NOT RECEIVE ME
THEN THE GENERAL SENT ME BACK THE LETTER BY AN AIDE DE CAMP INFORMING ME THAT IF I WERE FOUND THE NEXT DAY WITHIN THE CIRCUMSCRIPTION OF HIS COMMAND HE WOULD HAVE ME ARRESTED
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THE NOISE WHICH PRECEDED ME WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE CRYING VIVE LE ROI FOR WHAT KING DO THEY MEAN
MY GOOD PARRY SAID HE ORDER A FIRE DRINK EAT SLEEP AND BE HAPPY LET US BOTH BE HAPPY MY FAITHFUL FRIEND MY ONLY FRIEND WE ARE RICH AS RICH AS KINGS
ON WEDNESDAY ASIDE FROM A LITTLE MORE WHISPERING AND SIGNIFICANT GLANCES EXCHANGED AMONG THE PUPILS NOT A RIPPLE DISTURBED THE CALM OF THE STUDY HALL IT WAS THEREFORE A DISTINCT AND NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT SURPRISE WHEN MISS THOMPSON WALKED INTO THE ROOM
AND THAT A PAPER HAS BEEN CIRCULATED AND SIGNED BY CERTAIN PUPILS WHO PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO PLAY TRUANT AND ATTEND THE MATINEE TO MORROW THE EYES OF GRACE AND HER CHUMS TURNED QUESTIONINGLY TOWARD MABEL ALLISON WHO NODDED SLIGHTLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO THAT WAS WHAT ALL THE WHISPERING AND MYSTERY HAD MEANT
WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS MY CONTEMPT FOR THEM AND RIGHT HERE I ACCUSE GRACE HARLOWE AND HER SORORITY OF GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM MABEL ALLISON YESTERDAY AND CARRYING IT TO YOU THEY ARE ALL TALE BEARERS AND SNEAKS
GLAD TO KNOW THAT SAID GRACE THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF NOISES I COULDN'T DISTINGUISH IT THERE WAS ONE NOISE THAT STARTED THAT WAS PROMPTLY HUSHED SAID ANNE YOU HEARD IT TOO DIDN'T YOU JESSICA OH YES GIRLS I INTENDED TELLING YOU BEFORE THIS REPLIED JESSICA
ONLY MODERATELY CONCEALED OH THE LARGE LAUGHING MOUTHS AND HOW GAY WE WERE IN THOSE DAYS YOUTH WAS A BOUQUET
AND APPARENTLY WITH AS MUCH JOY AS COSETTE HERSELF AS HE HAD BEEN A MAYOR HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SOLVE THAT DELICATE PROBLEM
OF WHICH OF THE TWO FAUCHELEVENTS COSETTE WAS THE DAUGHTER THEY SAID WHAT WAS WANTED AND THEY SAID IT WITH ZEAL AN ACTE DE NOTORIETE WAS DRAWN UP COSETTE BECAME IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT
THAT THE CLOUD DID NOT LAST LONG SHE HAD MARIUS THE YOUNG MAN ARRIVED THE OLD MAN WAS EFFACED SUCH IS LIFE AND THEN COSETTE HAD FOR LONG YEARS BEEN HABITUATED TO SEEING ENIGMAS AROUND HER
WHICH HAD THE KINDNESS TO INDICATE THE HOUR BUT WHICH HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING MADE FOR THAT AND WHICH
I PREDICT THAT ALL WAS LOST
AND YET NO PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN START SUCCESSFULLY SO LONG AS THE PATIENT IS BROODING ON SECRET THOUGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS MIND THE DESIRE TO HIDE THEM MAY OFTEN BE ITSELF A PART OF THE DISEASE
IT IS SURPRISING HOW OFTEN UNSUSPECTED VISTAS OF THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES AND EMOTIONS ARE OPENED BY AN INQUIRING ANALYSIS WHERE THE DIRECT REPORT OF THE PATIENT DOES NOT AWAKEN THE LEAST SUSPICION
THERE ARE NO TWO CASES ALIKE AND NOT ONLY THE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE DIFFERENCES OF SEX AND AGE AND OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL MEANS AND TEMPERAMENT AND CAPACITY ARE DECISIVE
MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER FIELD OF MEDICINE THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF HAS TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE FAR BEYOND THE OFFICE HOURS AND THE STRICTLY MEDICAL RELATIONS AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE IN WHICH THE TREATMENT MIGHT NOT PROFIT BY THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE
EARLIER TIMES SURELY MAY HAVE TREATED EVEN THE STRONGER VARIETIES OF THIS KIND AS TROUBLESOME VARIATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF THE NORMAL
ESPECIALLY IN THE DIGESTIVE AND SEXUAL SPHERES ARE SOURCES OF IRRITATION WHICH SLOWLY INFLUENCE THE WHOLE PERSONALITY
IT IS SIMPLY MEANT THAT HE GIVE UP HIS FATIGUING DAILY WORK EVEN IF THAT WORK IS MADE UP OF A ROUND OF ENTERTAINMENTS AND CALLS AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS THE NEURASTHENIC AND ALL SIMILAR VARIETIES ARE SENT AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY AWAY FROM THE RUSH OF THEIR BUSY LIFE
AND IT WAS HE WHO WAS TO BE CHAIRMAN ON THIS AUSPICIOUS OCCASION BEHIND HIM CAME OLIVER BAREHEADED AND SPRUCE AND EVEN AT THAT DISTANCE HIS MOTHER AND WIFE COULD SEE HIS BRISK MOVEMENT
BUT A MESSENGER HAD COME TO HIS WIFE WITH THE NEWS THAT HER HUSBAND WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY WOUNDED AND WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE DOCTORS HE WAS A CATHOLIC EXPLAINED THE DRAWN FACED OLIVER HE MUST HAVE COME READY FOR HIS REPEATER WAS FOUND LOADED
SHE SAID THEN SHE BROKE OFF AND SAT BACK WHY DID HE SHOOT JUST THEN SHE ASKED OLIVER TURNED HIS EYES FOR AN INSTANT TOWARDS HIS MOTHER BUT SHE WAS KNITTING TRANQUILLY THEN HE ANSWERED WITH A CURIOUS DELIBERATENESS
BUT HE MUST HAVE MEANT TO DO IT ANYHOW CONTINUED OLIVER HOW DO THEY KNOW HE WAS A CATHOLIC ASKED THE GIRL AGAIN THERE WAS A ROSARY ON HIM AND THEN HE JUST HAD TIME TO CALL ON HIS GOD AND NOTHING MORE IS KNOWN
IF THEY WOULD NOT BE SUCH HEAVY FOOLS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND YES OLIVER THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A GLORIOUS THING IT ALL IS HUMANITY LIFE TRUTH AT LAST AND THE DEATH OF FOLLY BUT HAVEN'T I TOLD THEM A HUNDRED TIMES
THESE NEW BENNINSCHEIN EXPLOSIVES WILL MAKE CERTAIN OF THAT BUT IS IT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THE EAST HAS GOT THEM ABSOLUTELY BENNINSCHEIN SOLD THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY TO EAST AND WEST THEN HE DIED LUCKILY FOR HIM MABEL HAD HEARD THIS KIND OF TALK BEFORE
THE SECRETARY WHO BREAKFASTED WITH HER IN THE PARLOUR LOOKING ON TO THE GARDEN HAD APPEARED STRANGELY EXCITED HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD BE AWAY THE REST OF THE DAY MISTER OLIVER HAD GIVEN HIM HIS INSTRUCTIONS HE HAD REFRAINED FROM ALL DISCUSSION OF THE EASTERN QUESTION
THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY HOLD THE RECEIVER TO HER EAR SHE LISTENED WHO IS THERE HER HEART LEAPED AT THE SOUND OF HER HUSBAND'S VOICE TINY AND MINUTE ACROSS THE MILES OF WIRE I MABEL SHE SAID ALONE HERE
THEN MISTER POSTMAN PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD GO WITH HIM TO JOHNNY ALLSORT'S STORE AND GET SOME BEER WHILE THE DINNER WAS COOKING TO WHICH WE ALL AGREED
WELL WE WILL NOT QUARREL ABOUT A POUND SAID HE IT IS YOURS FOR FOUR ALL RIGHT SAID THE LOT OF US MISTER POSTMAN SELECTED WHAT WE SHOULD WANT TO BEGIN WITH SUCH AS A CRADLE BUCKETS ROPE PICKS SHOVELS
AS IT RAINED HEAVILY WE AGREED NOT TO START WORK UNTIL THE NEXT DAY SO WE RETURNED TO OUR TENT AND WROTE LETTERS INFORMING THE FOLKS AT HOME OF OUR SAFE ARRIVAL GOT TO WORK NEXT DAY AND TOOK IT IN TURNS ONE TO USE THE PICK AND THE OTHER THE SHOVEL
AMONG THE NEGROES OF SURINAM A WOMAN MUST LIVE IN SOLITUDE DURING THE TIME OF HER PERIOD IT IS DANGEROUS FOR ANY MAN OR WOMAN TO APPROACH HER AND WHEN SHE SEES A PERSON COMING NEAR SHE CRIES OUT ANXIOUSLY
AFTER DESCRIBING THE PHENOMENA ESPECIALLY THE PROHIBITION TO TOUCH THE GROUND OR SEE THE SUN FOUND AMONG VARIOUS RACES FRAZER CONCLUDES
ONLY A YOUTH WHO HAS NEVER TOUCHED A WOMAN OR A VIRGIN
IN THE GREAT SUGAR REFINERIES IN THE NORTH OF FRANCE THE REGULATIONS STRICTLY FORBID A WOMAN TO ENTER THE FACTORY WHILE THE SUGAR IS BOILING OR COOLING THE REASON GIVEN BEING THAT IF A WOMAN WERE TO ENTER DURING HER PERIOD THE SUGAR WOULD BLACKEN
SUCH A TASK MAY BEST BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE MINUTE STUDY OF ISOLATED CASES AND IN THIS PLACE I AM MERELY CONCERNED WITH THE GENERAL INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
IN AFFECTING THE SOCIAL POSITION OF WOMEN WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ELEMENTS THAT GO TO MAKE UP THAT INFLUENCE THERE IS ONLY ONE FURTHER POINT TO WHICH ATTENTION MAY BE CALLED
AND SCHOPENHAUER AND EVEN NIETZSCHE HAVE BEEN MORE INCLINED TO SIDE WITH THE PREACHER THAN WITH THE HALF NAKED PHILOSOPHERS OF TACITUS'S DAY BUT BOTH VIEWS ALIKE ARE BUT THE EXTREMES OF THE SAME PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION
TO BE A REASONABLE PROBABILITY OF THE RESULT BEING OF ADVANTAGE TO YOURSELF TRUSTING THAT YOU WILL LET US HAVE AN IMMEDIATE REPLY IN WHICH YOU WILL KINDLY NAME THE DAY AND HOUR WHEN WE MAY EXPECT TO SEE YOU WE ARE YOURS FAITHFULLY
SHE WAS RECALLED TO THE PRESENT BY THE VOICE OF DORA WHOM SHE NOW PERCEIVED TO BE READING THE LETTER OVER HER SHOULDER WITH UNBLUSHING INTEREST SAY SAID DORA ISN'T IT EXCITING SOMETHING TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M MADE OF CAST IRON SHE DEPARTED WITH AN INJURED AIR AND JULIET WENT TO LOOK FOR THE CONSUL WHAT IS IT HE ASKED AS SHE PUT THE ENVELOPE INTO HIS HAND A LETTER YOU WANT ME TO READ NOT A PROPOSAL EH
NO MY DEAR YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT BESIDES I PROMISED LENA I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU ARE THE CHILD OF A FRIEND OF HERS THAT IS ALL I KNOW I THINK SHE SCARCELY REALIZED HOW HARD IT WOULD BE FOR YOU NOT TO KNOW MORE WHEN YOU GREW UP
BUT AT LEAST IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SOME ONE MUST BE THERE TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS NO JULIET WOULD HAVE TO GO ALONE SHE WAS REALLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED BY HERSELF FOR THREE DAYS AND THERE WAS NO NEED THAT SHE COULD SEE
ON MONDAY MORNING SHE LEFT OSTEND IN THE COMPANY OF HER MAID IT WAS A GLORIOUS AUGUST DAY ON SHORE THE HEAT WAS INTENSE AND IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET OUT OF THE STIFLING CARRIAGES OF THE CROWDED BOAT TRAIN
WITH WHICH THE HEART OF THE EXILE IS SAID TO SWELL AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN LAND SHE WONDERED IF THE SIGHT OF THEIR COUNTRY MOVED OTHER PASSENGERS ON THE BOAT AS SHE HERSELF WAS MOVED AND MADE TIMID ADVANCES TO A LADY WHO WAS STANDING NEAR HER
NO DOUBT SHE THOUGHT WHEN THE SHIP STOPPED AND THEY FELT BETTER THEY WOULD BE MORE DISPOSED TO A SENTIMENTALITY LIKE HERS SHE FOUND HER MAID WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SEA SICK OF THOSE ABOARD AND ASSISTED HER ASHORE
SHE WAS GOING TO HEAR TREMENDOUS NEWS THAT DAY MAKE WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES ABOUT HER BIRTH HEAR UNDREAMT OF THINGS
ONE OF THESE WAS IN THE ACT OF SLACKENING THE ROPE BY WHICH THE BOAT HAD BEEN WARPED ALONGSIDE WHEN A RUNNING GESTICULATING FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE SHOUTING TO THEM TO WAIT FOR HIM WAITED FOR ACCORDINGLY HE WAS AND IN A FEW MINUTES GIMBLET
BOTH EQUALLY INSCRUTABLE AND UNFLINCHING THEN THE STRANGER GLANCED ASIDE AND STRODE ON TO WHERE A SMALL BOAT LAY MOORED THE DETECTIVE TURNED HIS BACK WHILE THE FAIR MAN GOT IN AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE LOCH GENTLEMAN GOING FISHING
A POLISH GINTLEMAN HE IS COUNT PRETOVSKY A VARY NICE GINTLEMAN I COULDNA JUST CAE HIM A TOURIST HE'S VARY KEEN ON THE FISHIN
IN THE MEANTIME THERE WILL BE NO HARM DONE BY A WATCH BEING KEPT ON THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT TROLLING FOR SALMON ON THE LOCH THE INSPECTOR AGREED AND WHEN THE INVERASHIEL STARTED AN HOUR LATER ON HER VOYAGE DOWN THE LOCH
HE COULD NOT BETTER HIMSELF BECAUSE THE PEOPLE REQUIRED HIM TO GIVE UNLIMITED FREE SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE OLD REGIME I HAVE EVEN KNOWN ONE TO BE KILLED BY THE CONTINUAL DEMANDS UPON HIM THERE WAS A TIME NOT SO LONG AGO EITHER
WHEN THE EDUCATED INDIAN STOOD IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BETWEEN HIS PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND SHADY POLITICIANS EVERY COMPLAINT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND HE WAS EXPECTED TO EXPOSE AND REDRESS EVERY WRONG
THEREFORE NO INFERIOR RACE FROM EVERY RACE SOME INDIVIDUALS HAVE MASTERED THE SAME CURRICULUM AND PASSED THE SAME TESTS AND IN SOME INSTANCES MEMBERS OF SO CALLED UNCIVILIZED RACES
BECAUSE OF THE RACIAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE RACE IS TRANSFORMED CERTAINLY THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE TRUTH OF THIS ASSERTION
MISTER HILL OF TEXAS IS REPUTED TO BE A MILLIONAIRE HOWARD GANSWORTH A GRADUATE OF CARLISLE AND PRINCETON
THE INDIANS VICTORY WAS COMPLETE THESE BOYS ALWAYS FIGHT THE BATTLE ON ITS OWN MERITS THEY PLAY A CLEAN GAME AND LOSE VERY FEW GAMES DURING THE SEASON ALTHOUGH THEY MEET ALL OUR LEADING UNIVERSITIES EACH ON ITS OWN HOME GROUNDS
SHOULD WE DEVOTE OURSELVES LARGELY TO EXPOSING THE NUMEROUS FRAUDS COMMITTED UPON INDIANS OR SHOULD WE KEEP CLEAR OF THESE MATTERS AVOID DISCUSSION OF OFFICIAL METHODS AND ACTION
THERE IS ANOTHER INDIAN DOCTOR NOT OF FULL BLOOD WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE CITY CLUB OF CHICAGO AND ACTIVE IN CIVIC REFORM IN SEVERAL MIDDLE WESTERN CITIES THERE ARE SUCCESSFUL DOCTORS AND DENTISTS OF MY RACE
AND VERY LONG LIVED IN WHICH PLACES THERE IS NO USE AT ALL OF PHYSIC THE NAME OF IT IS NOT ONCE HEARD DITHMARUS BLESKENIUS IN HIS ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF ICELAND SIXTEEN O SEVEN
AND BUT LITTLE AT THIS DAY EXCEPT IT BE FOR A FEW NICE IDLE CITIZENS SURFEITING COURTIERS AND STALL FED GENTLEMEN LUBBERS THE COUNTRY PEOPLE USE KITCHEN PHYSIC
AND WHAT WAS APOLLO BUT THE DEVIL THE GREEKS FIRST MADE AN ART OF IT AND THEY WERE ALL DELUDED BY APOLLO'S SONS PRIESTS ORACLES IF WE MAY BELIEVE VARRO PLINY COLUMELLA MOST OF THEIR BEST MEDICINES WERE DERIVED FROM HIS ORACLES
MISCENTES PRO CALIDIS FRIGIDA PRO FRIGIDIS HUMIDA PRO PURGANTIBUS ASTRINGENTIA BINDERS FOR PURGATIVES OMNIA PERTURBABANT IF THE PARTY MISCARRIED CURTIUM DAMNABANT CURTIUS KILLED HIM THAT DISAGREED FROM THEM
WITH ALL VIRTUOUS AND WISE MEN THEREFORE I HONOUR THE NAME AND CALLING AS I AM ENJOINED TO HONOUR THE PHYSICIAN FOR NECESSITY'S SAKE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN LIFTETH UP HIS HEAD AND IN THE SIGHT OF GREAT MEN HE SHALL BE ADMIRED
WHICH IN THE AFTERNOON ENVELOPED THE UPPER MOUNTAINS IN CLOUDS WE WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY AS NOW WE DREADED A SNOW STORM SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WE HEARD THE ROLL OF THUNDER AND LOOKING TOWARD THE VALLEY FOUND IT ALL ENVELOPED IN A THUNDERSTORM
FOR US AS CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF SUMMER IT HAD A SINGULAR CHARM AND WE WATCHED ITS PROGRESS WITH EXCITED FEELINGS UNTIL NEARLY SUNSET
BUT AFTER OUR LONG WANDERING IN RUGGED MOUNTAINS WHERE SO FREQUENTLY WE HAD MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS AND WHERE THE CROSSING OF EVERY RIDGE DISPLAYED SOME UNKNOWN LAKE OR RIVER
THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND PURE WITH A SHARP WIND FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE THERMOMETER TWENTY BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WE CONTINUED DOWN THE SOUTH FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN OUR ROAD LEADING OVER DRY GROUND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID THE SNOW ALMOST ENTIRELY
UNBROKEN BY RAVINES AND COVERED WITH PINES AND SNOW WHILE ON THE SIDE WE WERE TRAVELLING INNUMERABLE RIVULETS POURED DOWN FROM THE RIDGE
AND JACOB WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE BEST ANIMALS AND MY INTENTION WAS TO PROCEED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE HOUSE OF MISTER SUTTER AND RETURN TO MEET THE PARTY WITH A SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS AND FRESH ANIMALS
SHE USED TO SAY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS COME BOYS EMPTY YOUR POCKETS AND GATHER UP YOUR TOYS WE WILL PUT THE KNIVES AND MARBLES AWAY AND GET READY FOR SUNDAY ALL DAY SUNDAY THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO READ ANY BOOK BUT THE BIBLE
BUT JAMES LIKED THE STORIES HE FOUND THERE AND WHEN HE WAS ONLY NINE COULD SAY ALMOST HALF THE BIBLE BY HEART JAMES WAS THE OLDEST IN THE FAMILY HE WAS BORN IN LOWELL AND WAS SUCH A CUNNING BABY THAT EVERYBODY WANTED HIS PICTURE
THESE PICTURES WERE VERY GOOD AND WHEN HE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE APT TO ASK HIM TO MAKE ANIMALS AND BIRDS FOR THEM ON THE BLACKBOARD MAJOR WHISTLER SOON SENT FOR HIS FAMILY TO JOIN HIM IN RUSSIA
THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LITTLE RUSSIAN CHILDREN OR IN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE THEY WENT SKATING DRESSED IN HANDSOME FURS THEY LEARNED THE FOLK AND FANCY DANCES JOINED IN THE WINTER SPORTS AND VOTED RUSSIA A FINE COUNTRY
INSTEAD OF MAKING A FUSS ABOUT THIS HE USED TO CALL FOR PENCIL AND PAPER AND PRACTISE DRAWING FEET UNTIL HE COULD MAKE VERY PERFECT ONES MAJOR WHISTLER SENT HIM TO THE ART ACADEMY IN SAINT PETERSBURG WHERE HE WAS PRAISED BY HIS TEACHERS
IN THIS CITY HE WAS PRAISED EVEN MORE BUT HE DID NOT SELL ENOUGH PICTURES TO PAY HIS BILLS AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD KEPT MEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR MONEY THAT HE OWED THEM OFFICERS CAME AND TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY BUT HIS PICTURES
THERE WAS A TRIAL IN LONDON AND THE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED SOME WERE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY OWNED WHISTLER PICTURES AND WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD PAID GOOD MONEY FOR BAD PICTURES OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE WARM FRIENDS OF THE ARTIST OR THE CRITIC
TWO FAMOUS ONES OF WHICH WE OFTEN SEE PRINTS ARE PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER AND THE SCOTCH WRITER CARLYLE JAMES WHISTLER'S MOTHER LIVED TO BE AN OLD WOMAN AS ONE CAN GUESS FROM THE PICTURE
SHE TALKS OF THE FIRST WEEK IN DECEMBER AND WANTS YOU TO BE THERE FOR CHRISTMAS I DON'T AT ALL KNOW THAT I CAN GO MISTER MORTON WHY NOT GO I'M AFRAID MAMMA WILL NOT SPARE ME
AND NOW HE WAS TELLING HER WHAT HE THOUGHT I FANCIED THAT YOU WERE HAPPY HERE WITHOUT GOING TO SEE AN OLD WOMAN WHO AFTER ALL
MISTER MORTON SIR I THINK IS OUT WITH THE LADIES TAKING A DRIVE I WILL LEAVE A CARD THEN THE OLD LADY IS AT HOME SIR IF YOU WISH TO SEE HER CONTINUED THE SENATOR FOLLOWING REGINALD UP TO THE DOOR
WHICH WAS IN ITSELF OF ALL THINGS THE MOST PERNICIOUS IF MARY MUST GO TO CHELTENHAM WHY COULD SHE NOT GO BY HERSELF SECOND CLASS LIKE ANY OTHER YOUNG WOMAN
JOHN MORTON MIGHT DIE AND THEN WHO COULD TELL WHETHER LADY USHANT WOULD EVER RETURN TO CHELTENHAM IN THIS WAY THE SHORT LIVED PEACE SOON CAME TO AN END ESPECIALLY AS MISSUS MASTERS ENDEAVOURED TO UTILIZE FOR GENERAL FAMILY PURPOSES
THE COURT WAS HELD IN A LONG UNFURNISHED ROOM LATELY BUILT ONTO THE HOTEL AND INTENDED TO SERVE AS A BALL ROOM OR CONCERT HALL A REGIMENT OF REPORTERS WAS ENTRENCHED IN THE FRONT SEATS
AN UNDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE AND LISTENED IN AN AWED SILENCE TO THE OPENING SOLEMNITIES THE NEWSPAPER MEN WELL USED TO THESE
WITH THE SYMPATHY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT FOR THAT DARK FIGURE OF GRIEF SHE LIFTED HER THICK VEIL BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AND THE EXTREME PALENESS AND UNBROKEN COMPOSURE OF THE LADY
HE SAID THAT MISTER MARLOWE COULD DO IT QUITE EASILY IF HE HAD NO ACCIDENT HE SAID THAT HE HAD STARTED IN THE CAR AND THEN WALKED BACK HOME A MILE OR SO AND FELT ALL THE BETTER FOR IT DID HE SAY ANY MORE
HE SEEMED TO PREFER TO BE ALONE I CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION AT ALL OF THE CHANGE I TRIED TO WORK AGAINST IT I DID ALL I COULD WITH JUSTICE TO MY OWN DIGNITY AS I THOUGHT
THE GENERAL ATTENTION WHICH FOLLOWED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS NOW EAGERLY DIRECTED UPON MARTIN WHOM THE CORONER HAD PROCEEDED TO CALL IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT TRENT APPEARED AT THE DOORWAY AND EDGED HIS WAY INTO THE GREAT ROOM
SEE YE IF IT BE PIERCED IF SO IT BELONGETH TO SOME ONE OF THE FOLK IF NOT TIS A PROVISION OF ALLAH FOR US SO THEY EXAMINED IT AND FOUND IT UNPIERCED
AND CAROUSE WITH ME THIS NIGHT
BUT I WAS ABASHED AT HIS GENEROSITY AND WAS ASHAMED TO LIE WITH HER IN HIS HOUSE SO I SAID EQUIP HER AND SEND HER TO MY PLACE
AND HIS WIT AND GOOD BREEDING SO PLEASED HIM THAT HE MADE HIM ONE OF HIS CHIEF OFFICERS AND ALLAH IS THE GIVER THE BESTOWER MEN ALSO RELATE THE TALE OF THE WOMAN WHOSE HANDS WERE CUT OFF FOR GIVING ALMS TO THE POOR
AT THE DOOR IS A PILGRIM WIGHT WHO SEEKETH ADMISSION TO THEE QUOTH I ADMIT HIM SO HE CAME IN AND BEHOLD HE WAS A KHORASANI WE EXCHANGED SALUTATIONS AND HE SAID TO ME
AND OTHER TEN THOUSAND SAYING SPEND FREELY OF THIS AND AMEND THY CASE THEREWITH AND SET THINE AFFAIRS IN ORDER
WHO SAID TO HIM WHERE IS THE COTTON AND THE FOOD QUOTH HE SUCH AN ONE MET ME AND COMPLAINED TO ME OF WANT WHEREUPON I GAVE HIM THE PRICE OF THE YARN AND THEY SAID HOW SHALL WE DO WE HAVE NOTHING TO SELL
THAT THE MAN TOOK THE TRENCHER AND JAR TO THE BAZAR BUT NONE WOULD BUY THEM OF HIM HOWEVER THERE PRESENTLY PASSED BY A MAN WITH A FISH WHICH WAS SO STINKING AND SO SWOLLEN
AND NOW THIS IS THE WAY YOU PAY ME BACK DRUNK HALF THE TIME AND HALF DRUNK THE REST WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I TOLD YOU THE LAST TIME YOU GOT LOADED I MEAN IT TOO YOU RE NOT THE ONLY STAR IN SIGHT SEE SHE LAUGHED MEANLY
AT ITS CLOSE HE RELAPSED INTO STUPIDITY MURMURING SHE THROWED ME DOWN WELL SNEERED SADNESS YOU SEE DRUNKEN MEN TELL THE TRUTH AND YOU DON'T SEEM TO GET MUCH GUILT OUT OF OUR YOUNG FRIEND
STILL HE CREPT SLOWLY TOWARDS HER HIS LIPS WORKING AND HIS HANDS MOVING CONVULSIVELY JOE JOE SHE SAID HOARSELY WHAT S THE MATTER
FOR AN INSTANT SHE LOST THEIR STEADY GLARE AND THEN SHE FOUND HER VOICE THE SCREAM WAS CHECKED AS IT BEGAN HIS FINGERS HAD CLOSED OVER HER THROAT JUST WHERE THE GOWN HAD LEFT IT TEMPTINGLY BARE THEY GAVE IT THE CARESS OF DEATH
WHEN THE MOMENT COMES I KNOW THAT I SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE HER AND I KNOW THAT SHE'LL SEE IT
YOU ARE STRONGER THAN I AM HE SAID NOT STRONGER BUT MORE CERTAIN MAKE YOURSELF AS SURE AS I AM AND YOU TOO WILL BE STRONG IS IT NOT SO MAMMA
I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE IF YOU CAN GIVE HIM ANY HOPE MAMMA TELL ME THAT I MAY COME AGAIN IN A YEAR HE PLEADED I CANNOT TELL YOU SO YOU MAY NOT COME AGAIN NOT IN THIS WAY
SHE SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE SLOWLY ALMOST WITH DIFFICULTY BUT STILL THE WORDS CAME VERY CLEARLY WITH A CLEAR DISTINCT VOICE WHICH CAUSED THEM TO BE REMEMBERED WITH ACCURACY
MISSUS DALE HAD FELT FROM THE FIRST THAT EAMES WAS COMING TOO SOON THAT THE EARL AND THE SQUIRE TOGETHER WERE MAKING AN EFFORT TO CURE THE WOUND TOO QUICKLY AFTER ITS INFLICTION THAT TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO HER GIRL TO RECOVER
AND OF THIS MISSUS DALE SOON FELT HERSELF AWARE THE THING HAD TO BE DONE AND NO LITTLE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE SUCH AS THIS OF MISSUS DALE'S ENFORCED PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT IT OF THIS MISSUS DALE WAS WELL AWARE
HAVE A GLASS OF WINE BEFORE YOU GO OH DEAR NO I THINK I'LL GO BACK THROUGH THE SQUIRE'S FIELDS AND OUT ON THE ROAD AT THE WHITE GATE THE PATH IS QUITE DRY NOW I DARE SAY IT IS SAID MISSUS DALE LILY
LILY I HAVE COME OVER HERE ON PURPOSE TO SPEAK TO YOU INDEED I HAVE COME DOWN FROM LONDON ONLY THAT I MIGHT SEE YOU HAVE YOU JOHN YES I HAVE YOU KNOW WELL ALL THAT I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU
HE LOOKED LONGINGLY INTO HER FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE ALSO MIGHT KISS HIM THEN HE PRESSED HER HAND TO HIS LIPS AND WITHOUT SPEAKING ANY FURTHER FAREWELL TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LEFT THE ROOM POOR FELLOW
WAS IT NOT THE CASE THAT HE HAD SO FONDLY EXPECTED SUCCESS AS TO THINK ONLY OF HIS TRIUMPH IN RETURNING AND NOT OF HIS MORE PROBABLE DISGRACE HE HAD ALLOWED OTHERS TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIM
YOU SHALL NEVER DO THAT YES I WILL I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BUT YET I WILL GOOD BY MISSUS DALE HE SAID GOOD BY JOHN
AS IT WAS HE DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO HIS PLACE IN THE EARL'S HOUSE HOW COULD HE PRETEND TO MAINTAIN HIS ORDINARY DEMEANOUR UNDER THE EYES OF THOSE TWO OLD MEN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO GET HOME TO HIS MOTHER
IT WAS WELL FOR HIM THAT SHE HAD COME UPON HIM IN HIS SORROW WHEN HE ONCE KNEW THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIS TEARS
THE JUNIORS WILL GET THE REPUTATION AMONG THE TEACHERS THIS YEAR THAT THE JUNIOR CLASS HAD LAST AND IT SEEMS SUCH A PITY I OVERHEARD MISS CHESTER TELL MISS KANE THE OTHER DAY
SHE CERTAINLY WILL SAID NORA BUT TO GIVE THE PLAY A REST AND COME DOWN TO EVERYDAY AFFAIRS WHERE SHALL WE MEET TO GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME LET ME SEE SAID GRACE THE GAME IS TO BE CALLED AT THREE O'CLOCK
BEGAN THE READING OF THE DESIGNATED LINES HER VOICE SOUNDED UNUSUALLY CLEAR AND SWEET YET LACKED SOMETHING OF THE POWER OF EXPRESSION DISPLAYED BY GRACE IN HER RENDERING OF THE SAME SCENE WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED
THE GIRL WAS ANNE PIERSON WHO IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER HAD BEEN ALL BUT OVERLOOKED UNTIL MISS TEBBS SPIED HER STANDING BETWEEN GRACE AND NORA CAN YOU SPARE US A MOMENT MORE MISTER SOUTHARD SAID MISS TEBBS TO THE ACTOR WHO WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE
STOOD AWAITING HER REPLY I SHOULD LIKE TO DO THAT ELEANOR SAID SLOWLY A CURIOUS LIGHT IN HER EYES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS TEBBS
THOUGH OF COURSE HE DID NOT SAY SO AS THEY STROLLED ABOUT AFTERWARD HE MANAGED TO KEEP HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM AND ALLOWED KEMP TO APPROPRIATE HIS WIFE THEY FINALLY DRIFTED TO THE COTTAGE STEPS
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD OF ALL MY GLOWING COMPLIMENTS ON YOUR ROWING AND I WAS TELLING YOUR MOTHER THAT IN ALL MODESTY I WAS CONSIDERED A FINE OAR AT MY ALMA MATER
A THIRD IN YOUR LITTLE BOAT WILL BE THE PROVERBIAL TRUMPERY STILL I SUPPOSE I CAN RELY ON YOU TWO CRACK OARSMEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE SLIGHTEST TREMBLE IN THE BOAT IN THE FAIREST WEATHER IS LIKELY TO CREATE A SQUALL ON MY PART
PROBABLY THE DISPLAY AMUSED HIM WHAT WAS SHE TO HIM ANYWAY BUT A GIRL WITH WHOM HE COULD FLIRT IN HIS IDLE MOMENTS WELL WITH A PASSIONATE FLING OF HER ARMS SHE WOULD EXTINGUISH HER UNCONTROLLABLE LITTLE BEATER FOR THE NONCE
THE CRICKETS CHIRPED IN THE HEDGES NOW AND THEN A FIREFLY FLASHED BEFORE THEM
IN THE BOW I DISLIKE TO SEE DANGERS BEFORE WE COME TO THEM HE HELPED HER CAREFULLY TO HER PLACE SHE THANKED HIM LAUGHINGLY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ARM AND HE TURNED TO RUTH I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO MOVE FROM MY PLACE SHE SAID IN DEFIANT MISCHIEF
SHE LEANED A LITTLE FARTHER FORWARD LOOKING PAST KEMP MAMMA THEN SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF BACK IN HER SEAT
WHEN HE TURNED FOR RUTH SHE HAD ALREADY SPRUNG ASHORE AND HAD STARTED UP THE SLOPE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OARS LAY FORGOTTEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT
SHE COULD NOT YET MEET HIS EYES AGAIN COME RUTH EITHER STAY WITH US OR JUST AHEAD OF US
AS FOR M DANGLARS ABSORBED IN AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH M CAVALCANTI HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT WAS PASSING
AND HAD RETURNED JUST AS THEY WERE STARTING BUT INSTEAD OF EITHER OF THESE HE SAW NOTHING BUT A STRANGE FACE SUNBURNT AND ENCIRCLED BY A BEARD WITH EYES BRILLIANT AS CARBUNCLES
BUT THAT WITH WITH WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FRANCS I SHOULD BE QUITE HAPPY HERE ARE TWO HUNDRED SAID ANDREA
I SHALL LOOK LIKE SOME RETIRED BAKER THAT IS WHAT I WANT COME IF YOU WILL ONLY PUT THIS SCHEME INTO EXECUTION AND BE STEADY NOTHING COULD BE BETTER
I CAN SCARCELY STAND THE YOUNG MAN SHUDDERED AT THIS STRANGE FAMILIARITY TELL ME HE SAID TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT WELL THEN
WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE MAKING IN ALL ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FRANCS WHY I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE ARRESTED AT THE BARRIERS THEN TO JUSTIFY MYSELF I SHOULD SAY THAT YOU GAVE ME THE MONEY
THIS WOULD CAUSE INQUIRIES IT WOULD BE FOUND THAT I LEFT TOULON WITHOUT GIVING DUE NOTICE AND I SHOULD THEN BE ESCORTED BACK TO THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN THEN I SHOULD BECOME SIMPLY
AND GOOD BY TO MY DREAM OF RESEMBLING THE RETIRED BAKER NO NO MY BOY I PREFER REMAINING HONORABLY IN THE CAPITAL ANDREA SCOWLED CERTAINLY
WE SHALL SEE HE THEN TOOK THE GREAT COAT WITH THE LARGE COLLAR WHICH THE GROOM HAD LEFT BEHIND IN THE TILBURY AND PUT IT ON HIS BACK THEN HE TOOK OFF CAVALCANTI'S HAT WHICH HE PLACED UPON HIS OWN HEAD AND FINALLY
HE ASSUMED THE CARELESS ATTITUDE OF A SERVANT WHOSE MASTER DRIVES HIMSELF BUT TELL ME SAID ANDREA
BILLY ARE YOU VERY BUSY THIS MORNING NO INDEED NOT IF YOU WANT ME WELL I DO MY DEAR UNCLE WILLIAM'S VOICE WAS TROUBLED I WANT YOU TO GO WITH ME IF YOU CAN TO SEE A MISSUS GREGGORY SHE'S GOT A TEAPOT I WANT
I'LL TELL HER THOUGH AND I'LL SEE YOU AT ELEVEN FINISHED BILLY AS SHE HUNG UP THE RECEIVER PROMPTLY AT THE APPOINTED TIME BILLY MET UNCLE WILLIAM AT PARK STREET AND TOGETHER THEY SET OUT FOR THE WEST END STREET NAMED ON THE PAPER IN HIS POCKET
PERHAPS THEY THINK TOO WE WISH TO LIVE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS THAT WE WISH TO HAVE RUGS THAT ARE DARNED AND CHAIRS THAT ARE BROKEN AND GARMENTS THAT ARE PATCHES INSTEAD OF CLOTHES ALICE GASPED MISSUS GREGGORY IN DISMAYED HORROR
WITH A LITTLE OUTWARD FLING OF HER TWO HANDS ALICE GREGGORY STEPPED BACK HER FACE HAD GROWN WHITE AGAIN I BEG YOUR PARDON OF COURSE SHE SAID IN A VOICE THAT WAS BITTERLY QUIET I SHOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN SO
BUT IT WAS ONE THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED PERHAPS FROM BILLY MISSUS GREGGORY MUST HAVE DIVINED IN A WAY THE SPIRIT THAT PROMPTED IT FOR HER EYES GREW WET AND WITH A CHOKING DEAR CHILD SHE REACHED OUT AND CAUGHT BILLY'S HAND IN BOTH HER OWN
COME BILLY WE'LL BID YOU GOOD MORNING LADIES SAID WILLIAM HENSHAW THEN DECISIVELY AND BILLY WITH A LITTLE WISTFUL PAT ON MISSUS GREGGORY'S CLASPED HANDS WENT ONCE DOWN THE LONG FOUR FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AND OUT ON THE SIDEWALK
AND THERE'S THE TRAY DID YOU NOTICE HE EXULTED TURNING BACK TO THE SHELF YOU DON'T SEE THAT EVERY DAY THEY GET SEPARATED MOST GENERALLY YOU KNOW THESE PIECES HAVE BEEN IN OUR FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS SAID MISSUS GREGGORY WITH AN ACCENT OF PRIDE
MADAM IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO SELL HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY HIS LONGING EYES HAD GONE BACK TO THE ENTICING BIT OF CHINA MISSUS GREGGORY GAVE A LOW CRY BUT I DO THAT IS I MUST
THEN SAYS THE KING WHO ARE YOU I'M SAINT KAVIN SAID THE SAINT BLESSING HIMSELF OH QUEEN OF HEAVEN SAYS THE KING MAKING THE SIGN OF THE CROSS BETWEEN HIS EYES AND FALLING DOWN ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE SAINT IS IT THE GREAT SAINT KAVIN SAYS HE
THAT SERIES OF TERRIFIC EVENTS BY WHICH OUR QUIET CITY AND UNIVERSITY IN THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF GERMANY WERE CONVULSED DURING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN HAS IN ITSELF AND CONSIDERED MERELY AS A BLIND MOVEMENT OF HUMAN TIGER PASSION
AND DESERVES THE DEEP ATTENTION OF COMING GENERATIONS IN THEIR STRUGGLE AFTER HUMAN IMPROVEMENT NOT MERELY IN ITS OWN LIMITED FIELD OF INTEREST DIRECTLY AWAKENED BUT IN ALL ANALOGOUS FIELDS OF INTEREST
I KNEW FAMILIARLY ALL THE PARTIES WHO WERE CONCERNED IN IT EITHER AS SUFFERERS OR AS AGENTS I WAS PRESENT FROM FIRST TO LAST AND WATCHED THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE MYSTERIOUS STORM WHICH FELL UPON OUR DEVOTED CITY
WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR HIS SOMEWHAT MOORISH COMPLEXION THOUGH AFTER ALL THAT IS NOT OF A DEEPER TINGE THAN I HAVE SEEN AMONG MANY AN ENGLISHMAN HE IS HIMSELF ONE OF THE NOBLEST LOOKING OF GOD'S CREATURES
MOST OF WHOM WERE STILL UNACQUAINTED WITH THE CAUSE OF THE ALARMING INTERRUPTION A FEW HOWEVER WHO HAD HEARD HER FIRST AGITATED WORDS
UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND DISTINCTION IN REALITY HIS WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE HIS MILITARY HONORS AND THE DIGNITY OF HIS CHARACTER AS EXPRESSED IN HIS MANNERS AND DEPORTMENT
ON THE PART OF MARGARET IT SEEMED AS IF A NEW WORLD HAD DAWNED UPON HER THAT SHE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS SUSPECTED AMONG THE CAPACITIES OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE LIKE SOME BIRD SHE SEEMED WITH POWERS UNEXERCISED FOR SOARING AND FLYING
HERE THEN AND THUS FAR NOTHING BUT HAPPINESS HAD RESULTED FROM THE NEW ARRANGEMENT BUT IF THIS HAD BEEN LITTLE ANTICIPATED BY MANY FAR LESS HAD I FOR MY PART ANTICIPATED THE UNHAPPY REVOLUTION WHICH WAS WROUGHT IN THE WHOLE NATURE
AND THE SOLE RESOURCE FOR HIM AS I SAID OFTEN WAS TO QUIT THE CITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE PURSUITS OF ENTERPRISE OF AMBITION OR OF SCIENCE BUT HE HEARD ME AS A SOMNAMBULIST MIGHT HAVE HEARD ME DREAMING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
MERELY A MATTER OF DISTRACTING FRIEND MURPHY'S ATTENTION FOR TEN SECONDS AT THE END OF THE TEN SECONDS YOU WILL BE SEEN GOING UP THE STEPS TO THE FRONT DOOR
AND LEISURELY CLIMBED THEM AGAIN WAS WRENCHING VIOLENTLY AT THE BELL FOR A TIME MISTER MURPHY REGARDED HIM DISDAINFULLY THEN CROSSED OVER HELD BRIEF COLLOQUY AND RETURNED HOT CHANCE HE'S GOT OF BREAKING IN
ALTHOUGH HE HAD BELONGED TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORGANIZATION A VERY SHORT TIME WELL I THINK YOU'RE PERFECTLY HORRID CRIED BRENDA I MEAN THE DICKY I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WAY YOU MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER BRANDING THEM WITH HOT CIGARS AND MAKING THEM RUN BAREFOOT WINTER NIGHTS AND
HE ONLY LOOKED A LITTLE SHEEPISH THE OTHER FELLOWS SAID
HE WALKED OFF AS NICE AS YOU PLEASE WASN'T HE MAD AT THE TWO FELLOWS FOR TAKING HIM THERE OF COURSE NOT THAT'S A PART OF THE THING WHY THERE ARE FELLOWS IN CAMBRIDGE WHO WOULD GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER
A MATTER OF OPINION MURMURED BELLE UNDER HER BREATH YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER CRIED BRENDA IN SURPRISE NO I HAVEN'T HAPPENED TO ANSWERED PHILIP
RUTH LIVED IN THE SUBURBS AND AS BELLE HAD SAID OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL THE OTHER GIRLS SELDOM SAW HER AT RECESS EACH LITTLE GROUP HAD SO MANY PERSONAL THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT AN OUTSIDER WOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDEDLY IN THE WAY
WITH MIGHT AND MAIN BUT BY AND BY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHERE ALL THE GOOD THINGS CAME FROM THEN BEFORE LONG HE FELL TO PESTERING THE OLD MAN WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MATTER AT FIRST THE OLD MAN PUT HIM OFF WITH SHORT ANSWERS
SO HE ENTERED THE PASSAGEWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE WENT ON AND ON AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT KEPT GROWING LARGER AND LARGER AND BY AND BY POP OUT HE CAME AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGE SURE ENOUGH
THERE HE STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE WAVES BEATING AND DASHING ON THE ROCKS HE STOOD LOOKING AND WONDERING TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A PLACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING CAME WITH A WHIZ AND A RUSH AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT AND AWAY HE FLEW LIKE A BULLET
THAT WAS A VERY FINE THING TO SAY BUT BEFORE AN HOUR HAD GONE BY THE FIDDLER'S HEAD BEGAN TO HUM AND BUZZ LIKE A BEEHIVE I DON'T BELIEVE SAID HE THERE WOULD BE A GRAIN OF HARM IN MY PEEPING INSIDE THAT DOOR ALL THE SAME
WHY THUS SAID THE SECOND
ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND AND LOOK
THAT IS YOUR REWARD FOR YOUR SERVICE
AN ANGEL CAME AND SHOWED THE WAY TO MY SON
INTO THE HOUSE THEY HAULED THE POOR SERVANT AND INTO THE SAME ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN BEFORE AND THERE SAT THE YOUNG MAN AT A GRAND FEAST WITH HIS WIFE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AROUND HIM BUT WHEN THE YOUNG MAN SAW THE POOR SERVING MAN HE CAME TO HIM
THE SERVANT'S COMPANION ENTERED THE GATE AS THOUGH HE KNEW THE PLACE RIGHT WELL AND LED THE WAY UP ONE STREET AND DOWN ANOTHER UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A NOBLE HOUSE THAT STOOD A LITTLE APART BY ITSELF WITH GARDENS OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT TREES ALL AROUND IT
BUT SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WENT WRONG HIS WIFE AND HE FELL OUT AND QUARRELLED UNTIL THERE WAS NO LIVING TOGETHER AND SHE HAD TO GO BACK TO HER OLD HOME THEN HIS COMPANIONS DESERTED HIM AND NOW HE LIVED ALL ALONE YOURS IS A HARD CASE SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
HE SEEMED TO DOUBT NOTHING NOR FEAR NOTHING BUT TRUDGED STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL BY AND BY THEY SAW A LIGHT TWINKLING FAR AWAY AND WHEN THEY CAME TO IT THEY FOUND A GLOOMY STONE HOUSE AS UGLY AS EYES EVER LOOKED UPON
HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET THE RUBY RING WHICH HE HAD STOLEN FROM THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN'S FINGER
WAS SPEEDILY REACHED THEN IT WAS THAT LECOQ RESUMED HIS INQUIRIES WELL MY GOOD FELLOW HE BEGAN YOU HAVE TOLD ME THE PRINCIPAL FACTS NOW I SHOULD LIKE THE DETAILS
HALF FOR MYSELF BUT I WAS SO WET AND MISERABLE AND THE HORSE SEEMED SO DONE UP THAT I DECIDED TO GO HOME I DID GRUMBLE I CAN TELL YOU WELL I HAD JUST PASSED THE CORNER OF THE RUE PICARD
WHEN I SAW TWO WOMEN STANDING UNDER A LAMP SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OFF I DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM FOR WHEN A MAN IS AS OLD AS I AM WOMEN GO ON SAID LECOQ WHO COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS IMPATIENCE
I DID NOTICE SOMETHING STRANGE ONE OF THE TWO WOMEN CALLED THE OTHER MADAME AS LARGE AS LIFE WHILE THE OTHER SAID THEE AND THOU AND SPOKE AS IF SHE WERE SOMEBODY
THE NEWSPAPERS HAD REPORTED THE TRAGEDY AT THE WIDOW CHUPIN'S DRINKING DEN OF COURSE MORE OR LESS CORRECTLY AND EVERYBODY WISHED TO SEE THE VICTIMS
ONLY TO FALL IN FINE SPRAY UPON THE MARBLE THROUGH THE SMALL ARCHED WINDOWS A GRAY LIGHT STOLE IN ON THE EXPOSED BODIES BRINGING EACH MUSCLE INTO BOLD RELIEF
REVEALING THE GHASTLY TINTS OF THE LIFELESS FLESH AND IMPARTING A SINISTER ASPECT TO THE TATTERED CLOTHING HUNG AROUND THE ROOM TO AID IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CORPSES THIS CLOTHING AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IS SOLD
FOR NOTHING IS WASTED AT THE MORGUE HOWEVER LECOQ WAS TOO OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO REMARK THE HORRORS OF THE SCENE HE SCARCELY BESTOWED A GLANCE ON THE THREE VICTIMS
IT WOULD BRING IN A ROUND SUM MORE THAN ENOUGH TO COVER THE EXPENSES THE KEEPER'S REPLY SEEMED TO OFFER AN INDUCEMENT TO CONVERSATION BUT LECOQ DID NOT SEIZE IT
SUDDENLY I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THEM TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS SHIRT AND CALLING THE ATTENTION OF HIS COMPANIONS TO ONE OF THE UNKNOWN VICTIMS HE WHISPERED GUSTAVE
LECOQ HAD ENTERED THE LEFT WING OF THE PALAIS HE CLIMBED THE STAIRS TILL HE HAD REACHED THE THIRD FLOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE LONG NARROW BADLY LIGHTED CORRIDOR
AND LIFTING HER WITH HIS STRONG ARMS CARRIED HER OUT INTO THE PASSAGE THE WHOLE SCENE HAD BEEN SO BRIEF
IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HER TO SPEAK SHE LOVES THAT RASCAL INTENSELY AND HE HAS A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER HER YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID HE THREATENED HER WITH DEATH IF SHE BREATHED A WORD ABOUT LACHENEUR
AGAIN SET FOOT IN HIS OFFICE THE POOR CREATURE SEEMED NEARLY HEARTBROKEN
MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
AND THIS EMISSARY RETIRED AGAIN LEAVING US TOGETHER IN THE DARK THERE'S A BREEZE COMING JIM SAID SILVER WHO HAD BY THIS TIME ADOPTED QUITE A FRIENDLY AND FAMILIAR TONE I TURNED TO THE LOOPHOLE NEAREST ME AND LOOKED OUT
YOU'LL BE CAP'N NEXT I SHOULDN'T WONDER JUST OBLIGE ME WITH THAT TORCH AGAIN WILL YOU THIS PIPE DON'T DRAW
SPEAK UP TO THE OTHERS AH THE OTHERS RETURNED JOHN THEY'RE A NICE LOT AIN'T THEY YOU SAY THIS CRUISE IS BUNGLED AH BY GUM IF YOU COULD UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT'S BUNGLED YOU WOULD SEE
ONE SIDE WAS BLANK FOR IT HAD BEEN THE LAST LEAF THE OTHER CONTAINED A VERSE OR TWO OF REVELATION THESE WORDS AMONG THE REST WHICH STRUCK SHARPLY HOME UPON MY MIND WITHOUT ARE DOGS AND MURDERERS
I HAVE THAT CURIOSITY BESIDE ME AT THIS MOMENT BUT NOT A TRACE OF WRITING NOW REMAINS BEYOND A SINGLE SCRATCH SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT MAKE WITH HIS THUMB NAIL THAT WAS THE END OF THE NIGHT'S BUSINESS
HE HIMSELF SLEPT PEACEFULLY AND SNORED ALOUD YET
HERE IS A NARROW CORNER AS
AH MERRY REMARKED SILVER STANDING FOR CAP'N AGAIN YOU'RE A PUSHING LAD TO BE SURE BUT THIS TIME EVERYONE WAS ENTIRELY IN MERRY'S FAVOUR THEY BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE EXCAVATION
CAME SLOWLY UP WITH US THANK YE KINDLY DOCTOR SAYS HE YOU CAME IN IN ABOUT THE NICK I GUESS FOR ME AND HAWKINS
IT WAS A LARGE AIRY PLACE WITH A LITTLE SPRING AND A POOL OF CLEAR WATER OVERHUNG WITH FERNS THE FLOOR WAS SAND BEFORE A BIG FIRE LAY CAPTAIN SMOLLETT AND IN A FAR CORNER ONLY DUSKILY FLICKERED OVER BY THE BLAZE
THE THREE FELLOWS STILL ABROAD UPON THE ISLAND DID NOT GREATLY TROUBLE US A SINGLE SENTRY ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE US AGAINST ANY SUDDEN ONSLAUGHT AND WE THOUGHT BESIDES THEY HAD HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF FIGHTING
AT LAST I THINK IT WAS ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE DOCTOR AND I WERE STROLLING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WHERE IT OVERLOOKS THE LOWLANDS OF THE ISLE
NO SAID THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE MAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD WE KNOW THAT WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST NEWS WE HAD OF THE THREE PIRATES ONLY ONCE WE HEARD A GUNSHOT A GREAT WAY OFF AND SUPPOSED THEM TO BE HUNTING
AND TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR THE GIBBET WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL SORT OF KINDNESS THE DOCTOR HAILED THEM AND TOLD THEM OF THE STORES WE HAD LEFT AND WHERE THEY WERE TO FIND THEM BUT THEY CONTINUED TO CALL US BY NAME AND APPEAL TO US FOR GOD'S SAKE
TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
I RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR DISPUTES AND TO SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEW WORLD IF GOD WERE NOW TO CREATE SOMEWHERE IN THE IMAGINARY SPACES
MATTER SUFFICIENT TO COMPOSE ONE AND WERE TO AGITATE VARIOUSLY AND CONFUSEDLY THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS MATTER SO THAT THERE RESULTED A CHAOS AS DISORDERED AS THE POETS EVER FEIGNED
TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
AND THERE FORM AS IT WERE TWO POUCHES DENOMINATED THE AURICLES OF THE HEART WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HEART ITSELF AND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WARMTH IN THE HEART THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY
DESTITUTE OF THE ORGANS WHICH OTHERS USE IN SPEAKING ARE IN THE HABIT OF SPONTANEOUSLY INVENTING CERTAIN SIGNS BY WHICH THEY DISCOVER THEIR THOUGHTS TO THOSE WHO BEING USUALLY IN THEIR COMPANY HAVE LEISURE TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE
AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
THERE IS NONE THAT IS MORE POWERFUL IN LEADING FEEBLE MINDS ASTRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH OF VIRTUE
THE PUBLICATION IF MADE AT ALL SHOULD BE EFFECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER MY DEATH MY FATHER DIED ON THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO IT WILL BE SEEN THEREFORE
THE JOURNEY LASTED ALTOGETHER SIXTEEN DAYS AND DURING THAT TIME MISTER AND MISSUS BURNS WERE THE HOSPITABLE ENTERTAINERS WHEN MY FATHER RETURNED HE WROTE A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HOW THE MASTIFFS WENT TO ICELAND
WHICH WILL BE PUBLISHED BY MESSRS BLACKWOOD AND SONS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY MY FATHER LEFT LONDON AND WENT TO LIVE AT HARTING A VILLAGE IN SUSSEX BUT ON THE CONFINES OF HAMPSHIRE
I THINK HE CHOSE THAT SPOT BECAUSE HE FOUND THERE A HOUSE THAT SUITED HIM AND BECAUSE OF THE PRETTINESS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HIS LAST LONG JOURNEY WAS A TRIP TO ITALY IN THE LATE WINTER AND SPRING OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
NOR WITHOUT DOING SO SHOULD I KNOW HOW TO THROW MY MATTER INTO ANY RECOGNISED AND INTELLIGIBLE FORM THAT I OR ANY MAN SHOULD TELL EVERYTHING OF HIMSELF I HOLD TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
THERE WERE EVER SO MANY OTHER PUNISHMENTS ACCUMULATED ON OUR HEADS IT BROKE MY HEART KNOWING MYSELF TO BE INNOCENT AND SUFFERING ALSO UNDER THE ALMOST EQUALLY PAINFUL FEELING THAT THE OTHER THREE NO DOUBT WICKED BOYS
HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AND WHEN HE TOOK THIS SECOND FARM NO CAPITAL THIS WAS THE LAST STEP PREPARATORY TO HIS FINAL RUIN
IT WAS HIS AMBITION TO DESCRIBE ALL ECCLESIASTICAL TERMS INCLUDING THE DENOMINATIONS OF EVERY FRATERNITY OF MONKS AND EVERY CONVENT OF NUNS WITH ALL THEIR ORDERS AND SUBDIVISIONS
I WONDER HOW MANY DOZEN TIMES I READ THOSE TWO FIRST VOLUMES
THERE WAS OFTEN A DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH ME ON THIS OCCASION MY AMUSEMENT CONSISTED IN WANDERING ABOUT AMONG THOSE OLD DESERTED BUILDINGS AND IN READING SHAKESPEARE OUT OF A BI COLUMNED EDITION
BOOTS WAISTCOATS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS WHICH WITH SOME SLIGHT SUPERVEILLANCE WERE AT THE COMMAND OF OTHER SCHOLARS WERE CLOSED LUXURIES TO ME MY SCHOOLFELLOWS OF COURSE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO AND I BECAME A PARIAH
FROM BARNS TO COWSHEDS AND FROM COWSHEDS TO DUNG HEAPS ONE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE ONE BEGAN AND THE OTHER ENDED THERE WAS A PARLOUR IN WHICH MY FATHER LIVED SHUT UP AMONG BIG BOOKS
BUT I PASSED MY MOST JOCUND HOURS IN THE KITCHEN MAKING INNOCENT LOVE TO THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER THE FARM KITCHEN MIGHT BE VERY WELL THROUGH THE EVENING WHEN THE HORRORS OF THE SCHOOL WERE OVER BUT IT ALL ADDED TO THE CRUELTY OF THE DAYS
WHICH WAS MAKING FOR TROITSA THE COUNTESS ON HEARING THAT MOSCOW WAS ON FIRE BEGAN TO CRY NATASHA PALE WITH A FIXED LOOK WAS SITTING ON THE BENCH UNDER THE ICONS JUST WHERE SHE HAD SAT DOWN ON ARRIVING
PAID UNCEASING ATTENTION TO HER COUSIN LOOK NATASHA HOW DREADFULLY IT IS BURNING SAID SHE WHAT'S BURNING ASKED NATASHA OH YES MOSCOW
THEN TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD WITH HER LIPS AS IF TO FEEL WHETHER SHE WAS FEVERISH AND FINALLY KISSED HER YOU ARE COLD
IT WAS HER OWN HEART SINKING WITH ALARM AND TERROR AND OVERFLOWING WITH LOVE SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND STEPPED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD AND ONTO THE COLD DAMP EARTHEN FLOOR OF THE PASSAGE THE COLD SHE FELT REFRESHED HER
ON WHICH SOMETHING WAS LYING STOOD A TALLOW CANDLE WITH A LONG THICK AND SMOLDERING WICK FROM THE MOMENT SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT MORNING OF PRINCE ANDREW'S WOUND AND HIS PRESENCE THERE NATASHA HAD RESOLVED TO SEE HIM
HE FELT PRINCE ANDREW'S PULSE AND TO HIS SURPRISE AND DISSATISFACTION FOUND IT HAD IMPROVED HE WAS DISSATISFIED BECAUSE HE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT IF HIS PATIENT DID NOT DIE NOW HE WOULD DO SO A LITTLE LATER WITH GREATER SUFFERING
IS HE ALIVE WHEN LOVING WITH HUMAN LOVE ONE MAY PASS FROM LOVE TO HATRED BUT DIVINE LOVE CANNOT CHANGE NO NEITHER DEATH NOR ANYTHING ELSE CAN DESTROY IT IT IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
NOT AS HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST WITH NOTHING BUT HER CHARMS WHICH GAVE HIM DELIGHT BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME PICTURING TO HIMSELF HER SOUL AND HE UNDERSTOOD HER FEELINGS HER SUFFERINGS SHAME AND REMORSE
TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI BOOM FLOPPED THE FLY AND HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY CARRIED INTO ANOTHER WORLD
BUT HE COULD NOT AND DELIRIUM DREW HIM BACK INTO ITS DOMAIN THE SOFT WHISPERING VOICE CONTINUED ITS RHYTHMIC MURMUR SOMETHING OPPRESSED HIM AND STRETCHED OUT AND THE STRANGE FACE WAS BEFORE HIM
AND HELD OUT HIS HAND YOU HE SAID HOW FORTUNATE WITH A RAPID BUT CAREFUL MOVEMENT NATASHA DREW NEARER TO HIM ON HER KNEES AND TAKING HIS HAND CAREFULLY
AS JUDGING BY WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID IT SEEMED MIGHT EASILY HAPPEN SHE COULD NOT OPPOSE NATASHA THOUGH WITH THE INTIMACY NOW ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE WOUNDED MAN AND NATASHA THE THOUGHT OCCURRED THAT SHOULD HE RECOVER THEIR FORMER ENGAGEMENT WOULD BE RENEWED
IT HAD NEVER REACHED WHEN HE WAS IN HEALTH BUT SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ITS WORK IT WOULD TURN TO SOME UNEXPECTED IDEA AND HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO TURN IT BACK AGAIN YES A NEW HAPPINESS WAS REVEALED TO ME OF WHICH MAN CANNOT BE DEPRIVED
HE THOUGHT AS HE LAY IN THE SEMIDARKNESS OF THE QUIET HUT GAZING FIXEDLY BEFORE HIM WITH FEVERISH WIDE OPEN EYES A HAPPINESS LYING BEYOND MATERIAL FORCES OUTSIDE THE MATERIAL INFLUENCES THAT ACT ON MAN
EVERY MAN CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT TO CONCEIVE IT AND ENJOIN IT WAS POSSIBLE ONLY FOR GOD BUT HOW DID GOD ENJOIN THAT LAW AND WHY WAS THE SON AND SUDDENLY THE SEQUENCE OF THESE THOUGHTS BROKE OFF
TO THE SOUND OF THIS WHISPERED MUSIC HE FELT THAT HE HAD TO BALANCE CAREFULLY THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT SO THAT THIS AIRY STRUCTURE SHOULD NOT COLLAPSE BUT NEVERTHELESS IT KEPT COLLAPSING AND AGAIN SLOWLY RISING TO THE SOUND OF
THOSE THAT LIVED THERE THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED IT WAS IN THIS VILLAGE THAT BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS NEIGHBORS LIVED IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF TOWN TOO
THOUGH YOU PERHAPS MIGHT NOT CARE FOR THEM AT ALL THEY WANTED THEIR HOUSES TO BE SURROUNDED BY WATER BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFER WHEN BUILT IN THAT MANNER AND THEY ALWAYS INSISTED THAT A DOOR LEADING INTO A HOUSE
AND HE BUILT IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A NEAT NEW HOUSE THAN ONE OF THE BIG OLD DWELLINGS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD HELPED THROW THE DAM ACROSS THE STREAM THE DAM WAS THERE STILL
BEING A NEWSPAPER HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO SAY NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT WAS NEWS NOT EVEN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER RABBIT OF PINE RIDGE WITH HIS WIFE AND FOURTEEN CHILDREN IS VISITING HIS BROTHER MISTER JEREMIAH RABBIT
JIMMY RABBIT ALMOST CUT OFF FRISKY SQUIRREL'S TAIL MISTER CROW PAUSED AND LOOKED AT BROWNIE BEAVER OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE KNEW THAT BROWNIE WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHAT PREVENTED THE ACCIDENT BUT HE WAS IN NO HURRY TO TELL HIM
THERE WAS MISTER CROW SITTING UPON ONE OF THE FALLEN TREES
WITH A LUNCH BASKET IN HIS HAND ALL READY TO BEGIN HIS LONG JOURNEY SAY GOOD BY TO HIM THEN SAID MISTER CROW FOR YOU'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN GRANDADDY BEAVER ASKED
THAT HE APPEARED PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO THE HEARTRENDING SCENES WHICH DAILY OCCURRED IN HIS PRESENCE IT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE STEAMER'S VOYAGE THAT POMPEY SELECTED FIVE OF THE OLD SLAVES TOOK THEM IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES AND COMMENCED PREPARING THEM FOR THE MARKET
ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A MAN WHO FROM APPEARANCE WAS NOT LESS THAN FORTY IF I LIVE TO SEE NEXT CORN PLANTING TIME I WILL EITHER BE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHICH
THE PATRIOT STOPPED TO TAKE IN PASSENGERS AND STILL NO STEAM WAS PERMITTED TO ESCAPE
AND AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ONE OF THE BOILERS IMMEDIATELY EXPLODED ONE DENSE FOG OF STEAM FILLED EVERY PART OF THE VESSEL WHILE SHRIEKS GROANS AND CRIES WERE HEARD ON EVERY HAND THE SALOONS AND CABINS SOON HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HOSPITAL
YOU HAVE BEAT ME SAID SMITH AS SOON AS HE SAW THE CARDS JERRY WHO WAS STANDING ON TOP OF THE TABLE WITH THE BANK NOTES AND SILVER DOLLARS ROUND HIS FEET WAS NOW ORDERED TO DESCEND FROM THE TABLE
YOU WILL NOT FORGET THAT YOU BELONG TO ME SAID JOHNSON AS THE YOUNG SLAVE WAS STEPPING FROM THE TABLE TO A CHAIR NO SIR REPLIED THE CHATTEL
TAKING IN FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS WALKER WHO HAD BEEN ON SHORE TO SEE SOME OF HIS OLD CUSTOMERS RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A TALL THIN FACED MAN DRESSED IN BLACK WITH A WHITE NECKCLOTH WHICH IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE A CLERGYMAN
I ONLY WANT ONE FOR MY OWN USE AND WOULD NOT NEED ANOTHER SAID THE MAN IN BLACK AS HE AND THE TRADER LEFT THE ROOM WALKER AND THE PARSON WENT INTO THE SALOON TALKED OVER THE MATTER THE BILL OF SALE WAS MADE OUT THE MONEY PAID OVER
AND YOU CAN'T MANAGE THEM YOU'RE A TRAITOR YOURSELF I KNOW YOU I'LL FLAY YOU ALL ALIVE AND AS IF AFRAID OF WASTING HIS STORE OF ANGER HE LEFT ALPATYCH AND WENT RAPIDLY FORWARD ALPATYCH MASTERING HIS OFFENDED FEELINGS KEPT PACE WITH ROSTOV AT A GLIDING GAIT
MEEK AND FLUSTERED VOICES HERE AND THERE WERE HEARD CALLING
BE OFF TO YOUR HOUSES AT ONCE AND DON'T LET ONE OF YOUR VOICES BE HEARD WHY WE'VE NOT DONE ANY HARM WE DID IT JUST OUT OF FOOLISHNESS IT'S ALL NONSENSE I SAID THEN THAT IT WAS NOT IN ORDER VOICES WERE HEARD BICKERING WITH ONE ANOTHER
AT THE INN AT YANKOVO HE RESPECTFULLY TOOK LEAVE OF HER FOR THE FIRST TIME PERMITTING HIMSELF TO KISS HER HAND HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO HE BLUSHINGLY REPLIED TO PRINCESS MARY'S EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR HER DELIVERANCE AS SHE TERMED WHAT HAD OCCURRED
THANKED HIM WITH THE WHOLE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE RADIANT WITH GRATITUDE AND TENDERNESS SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO THANK HIM FOR ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED TO HER CERTAIN THAT HAD HE NOT BEEN THERE SHE WOULD HAVE PERISHED AT THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS AND OF THE FRENCH
SATISFACTORY INDEED VERY SATISFACTORY BARBARA IVANOVNA TOLD ME TODAY HOW OUR TROOPS ARE DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES IT CERTAINLY DOES THEM CREDIT AND THE PEOPLE TOO ARE QUITE MUTINOUS
VORONTSOVO TO SEE THE GREAT BALLOON LEPPICH WAS CONSTRUCTING TO DESTROY THE FOE AND A TRIAL BALLOON THAT WAS TO GO UP NEXT DAY THE BALLOON WAS NOT YET READY BUT PIERRE LEARNED THAT IT WAS BEING CONSTRUCTED BY THE EMPEROR'S DESIRE
THE COMFORTS OF LIFE WEALTH EVEN LIFE ITSELF IS RUBBISH IT IS PLEASANT TO THROW AWAY COMPARED WITH SOMETHING WITH WHAT PIERRE COULD NOT SAY AND HE DID NOT TRY TO DETERMINE FOR WHOM AND FOR WHAT HE FELT SUCH PARTICULAR DELIGHT IN SACRIFICING EVERYTHING
AND GO ON EXCHANGING I SHALL CERTAINLY LOSE AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT EXCHANGE WHEN MY OPPONENT HAS SIXTEEN MEN AND I HAVE FOURTEEN I AM ONLY ONE EIGHTH WEAKER THAN HE BUT WHEN I HAVE EXCHANGED THIRTEEN MORE MEN
HE WILL BE THREE TIMES AS STRONG AS I AM BEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO OUR STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO THE FRENCH WAS ABOUT AS FIVE TO SIX BUT AFTER THAT BATTLE IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN ONE TO TWO PREVIOUSLY
WE HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND AFTERWARDS LITTLE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED THOUSAND YET THE SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THE BATTLE WHILE NAPOLEON
AND THAT THOSE BEGUN ON THE TWENTY FIFTH AND TWENTY SIXTH WERE NOT COMPLETED AND SECONDLY BY THE POSITION OF THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT THAT REDOUBT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN FRONT OF THE POSITION WHERE THE BATTLE WAS ACCEPTED
YOUR MOTHER INSISTS UPON YOUR ACCEPTING IT IS IT NOT SO MISSUS BENNET YES OR I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AN UNHAPPY ALTERNATIVE IS BEFORE YOU ELIZABETH
I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN TALKING TO UNDUTIFUL CHILDREN
AFTER BREAKFAST THE GIRLS WALKED TO MERYTON TO INQUIRE IF MISTER WICKHAM WERE RETURNED AND TO LAMENT OVER HIS ABSENCE FROM THE NETHERFIELD BALL HE JOINED THEM ON THEIR ENTERING THE TOWN
THAT I HAD BETTER NOT MEET MISTER DARCY THAT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM THE SAME PARTY WITH HIM FOR SO MANY HOURS TOGETHER MIGHT BE MORE THAN I COULD BEAR AND THAT SCENES MIGHT ARISE UNPLEASANT TO MORE THAN MYSELF
BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
FOR THOUGH FEELING ALMOST SECURE AND WITH REASON FOR CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN TOLERABLY ENCOURAGING HE WAS COMPARATIVELY DIFFIDENT SINCE THE ADVENTURE OF WEDNESDAY HIS RECEPTION HOWEVER WAS OF THE MOST FLATTERING KIND
SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE HER THE INFORMATION HERSELF AND THEREFORE CHARGED MISTER COLLINS WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONGBOURN TO DINNER TO DROP NO HINT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY
AND MISSUS BENNET WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CORDIALITY SAID HOW HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE TO SEE HIM AT LONGBOURN AGAIN
AND HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ITS HAPPY EFFECT JANE'S TEMPER WAS NOT DESPONDING AND SHE WAS GRADUALLY LED TO HOPE THOUGH THE DIFFIDENCE OF AFFECTION SOMETIMES OVERCAME THE HOPE THAT BINGLEY WOULD RETURN TO NETHERFIELD
WHILE MEASURE IS THE GROUPING OF THESE BEATS ACCORDING TO SOME SPECIFIED SYSTEM IN LISTENING TO A PIECE OF MUSIC TWO HEARERS A AND B MAY FEEL THE RHYTHM EQUALLY STRONGLY
ARE ALSO CLASSIFIED AS COMPOUND MEASURES AN ENGLISH WRITER
IN WHICH THERE ARE THREE BEATS THE FIRST ONE BEING ACCENTED THE SECOND AND THIRD UNACCENTED
BUT USAGE VARIES SOMEWHAT AND THE SECOND SIGN IS SOMETIMES USED TO INDICATE FOUR HALF MEASURE
TENTS AND BEDDING SUFFICIENT TO LAST UNTIL SOME OF OUR NUMEROUS PLANS OF WORK AFTER OUR ARRIVAL BROUGHT IN RETURNS MY HOPE WAS TO MEET MY FATHER THERE FOR HE HAD WRITTEN THAT HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD GO TO THE NEW GOLD FIELDS
AND THE SHIP WAS WELL MANNED I WAS NOW MUCH GRATIFIED TO LEARN THAT THERE WERE MANY ON BOARD WHOM I HAD MET BEFORE THAT THE STEWARD STEWARDESS AND SEVERAL OF THE WAITERS HAD BEEN ON DUTY ON THE STEAMER BERTHA
AND I FOUND NO BETTER OR MORE CONGENIAL COMPANIONS ON BOARD THE SHIP THAN THESE FOUR HONEST HARD WORKING WOMEN SO FULL OF HOPE COURAGE AND GOOD SENSE AS WELL AS CHRISTIANITY
LITTLE DID I THEN THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE PLACED BY A SEEMING CHANCE IN AN ADJOINING STATEROOM WERE TO BE MY FELLOW WORKERS AND TRUE FRIENDS NOT ONLY FOR THE COMING MONTHS IN THAT ARCTIC LAND TO WHICH WE WERE GOING BUT
AND A PRACTISED CLOG DANCER EXCITED THE RISIBLES OF THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY USUALLY SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER AT HIS EXHIBITION OF FLYING HEELS DAY AFTER DAY PASSED
THERE WERE OTHER WHITE WOMEN IN CAMP BY THIS TIME AND MANY STRANGERS AT THE HOTEL AMONG OTHERS OFFICIALS AND THOSE IN AUTHORITY SINCE THE STONE THROWING EPISODE THE MARSHAL HAD BEEN DOING DUTY AS WATCHMAN
THEY CAME FROM THE EAST WEST NORTH AND SOUTH ALL SORRY TO KNOW OF HER ILLNESS AND BRINGING PRESENTS WITH THEM SOMETIMES IT WAS A LITTLE LIVE BIRD OR SQUIRREL A DELICIOUS SALMON TROUT
THE OTHER INSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF SOMETHING LIKE MIGRATION THEIR GREAT NUMBERS AND THEIR HOMOGENEITY OVER AND OVER IN THESE ANNALS OF THE DAMNED OCCURS THE DATUM OF SEGREGATION
WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
JULY TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
NEVERTHELESS THE TREATMENT BY THE ZOOLOGIST OF THE FALL REPORTED FROM MOUNTAIN ASH IS FAIR FIRST APPEARS
OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
SAVE IN THE PARTICULAR SPOT MENTIONED IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE VICAR GRIFFITH WRITES AN ACCOUNT THE ROOFS OF SOME HOUSES WERE COVERED WITH THEM
THE FISH WERE ALL DEAD AND INDEED STIFF AND HARD WHEN PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE BY ALL OF WHICH I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO PILE UP OUR DATA OF THINGS THAT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OVERHEAD
THIS TIME THE OTHER MECHANICAL THING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE CANNOT RISE IN RESPONSE TO ITS STIMULUS IT IS RESISTED IN THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE COATED WITH ICE MONTH OF MAY IN A SOUTHERN STATE IF A WHIRLWIND AT ALL
QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
AND THAT IN HIS OPINION THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME UNUSUAL CONDITION ALOFT COMES OUT IN HIS OBSERVATION UPON THE CURIOUS AZURE BLUE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME
ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
AND THAT HE HAD BETTER TURN HIS ATTENTION TO THE STOCKS OF MESS PORK
JIM WAS ALL RIGHT IN HIS WAY BUT IT WAS A NEW WAY AND I HADN'T BEEN BROAD GAUGED ENOUGH TO SEE THAT IT WAS A BETTER WAY THAT WAS WHERE I CAUGHT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND BUSINESS
LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS BULLING THE MARKET THE LONGS ALL SAID THAT I WAS A KIND HEARTED OLD PHILANTHROPIST WHO WAS LAYING AWAKE NIGHTS SCHEMING TO GET THE FARMERS A TOP PRICE FOR THEIR HOGS
AND THE SHORTS ALLOWED THAT I WAS AN INFAMOUS OLD ROBBER WHO WAS STEALING THE PORK OUT OF THE WORKINGMAN'S POT AS LONG AS YOU CAN'T PLEASE BOTH SIDES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S NOTHING LIKE PLEASING YOUR OWN SIDE
AND THEN SHE'D SHED ALL WORRY OVER THEM FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALLOWED THAT IF THEY GOT HURT THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BRING THEM HOME
BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE LEFT HOME TO GET A FEW INDIAN SCALPS AND THAT HE CAME BACK FOR A LITTLE BACON AND CORN PONE I SIMPLY MENTION THE WIDOW IN PASSING AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT THE TIME TO DO YOUR WORRYING IS WHEN A THING IS ALL OVER AND THAT THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO LEAVE IT TO THE NEIGHBORS
AND WE KNOW DEFINITELY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GAMBLING FOR IT HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING A COUPLE OF LEADS HERE PRETTY SHORT LEADS SO FAR BUT YOU WORK WITH WHAT YOU CAN GET HE NODDED AT THE TABLE
EVERY LAST MUSCLE IN TRIGGER'S BODY SEEMED TO GO LIMP SIMULTANEOUSLY SHE SETTLED BACK SLIGHTLY IN THE CHAIR SURPRISED BY THE FORCE OF THE REACTION SHE HADN'T REALIZED BY NOW HOW KEYED UP SHE WAS SHE SIGHED A SMALL SIGH
QUILLAN DOES HAVE A DEGREE IN SUBSPACE ENGINEERING AND GETS ASSIGNED TO THE ENGINEERS NOW AND THEN BUT HIS REAL JOB'S SPACE SCOUT INTELLIGENCE TRIGGER NODDED I'D ALMOST GUESSED IT SHE GAVE QUILLAN ANOTHER SMILE
HOLATI COULD THOSE THINGS EVER BECOME AS VALUABLE AS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING IT'S ALL SOUNDED A LITTLE EXAGGERATED TO ME THE COMMISSIONER SAID HE'D WONDERED ABOUT IT TOO
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GRAB ME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET WE'RE HOPING WE WILL IN A VERY FEW DAYS IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN'T TELL ME ABOUT
ADMINISTRATION TERRORISM THE ADMINISTRATION TRIED IN ANOTHER WAY TO STOP PICKETING
MASSACHUSETTS MISSUS AGNES H MOREY BROOKLINE MISSUS WILLIAM BERGEN AND MISS CAMILLA WHITCOMB WORCESTER MISS ELLA FINDEISEN LAWRENCE MISS L J C DANIELS BOSTON NEW JERSEY
LEFT NOSTRIL THROAT AND MUSCLES OF NECK VERY SORE ALL NIGHT AFTER THIS I WAS BROUGHT INTO THE HOSPITAL IN AN AMBULANCE MISSUS LEWIS AND I PLACED IN SAME ROOM SLEPT HARDLY AT ALL THIS MORNING DOCTOR LADD APPEARED WITH HIS TUBE
ONE OF THE PARTY MISS FINDEISEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD ATTACK US TO WHICH THE MATRON REPLIED THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND HURRIED US ALONG THE BAYING GREW LOUDER AND NEARER AT TIMES AND THEN MORE DISTANT AS THE DOGS RUSHED BACK AND FORTH
A DEPUTY MARSHAL MUST SERVE THE WRIT COUNSEL SOUGHT A DEPUTY FOR MILES AROUND WASHINGTON NOT ONE WAS TO BE FOUND AT HIS HOME OR LODGINGS NONE COULD BE REACHED BY TELEPHONE
WHERE HE KEPT HIMSELF DISCREETLY HIDDEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHEN A DEPUTY WAS FOUND SIX ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SERVE THE WRIT ALL FAILED FINALLY BY A RUSE MISTER WHITTAKER WAS CAUGHT AT HIS HOME LATE AT NIGHT
I BADE THEM BOTH GOOD BY
THEY TOOK ME TO MISTER WHITTAKER'S OFFICE
I SLEPT WITH DOROTHY DAY IN A SINGLE BED I WAS HANDCUFFED ALL NIGHT AND MANACLED TO THE BARS PART OF THE TIME FOR ASKING THE OTHERS HOW THEY WERE AND WAS THREATENED WITH A STRAITJACKET AND A BUCKLE GAG THURSDAY NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH
OH WIDOW SAYS SHE I HAVE BAD NEWS TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING WHAT IS THAT SAID I ARE THE VIRGINIA SHIPS TAKEN BY THE FRENCH FOR THAT WAS MY FEAR NO NO SAYS SHE
I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND LAUGHING TO HIM PULLED IT OUT AND THERE WAS IN IT THREE GUINEAS AND A HALF
AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
AND AS I HAD REALLY WRITTEN BACK TO MY MOTHER IN PARTICULAR TO REPRESENT MY CONDITION AND THE GREAT LOSS I HAD RECEIVED
AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
BY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVER
THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
STILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEA
BY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOOD
HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
WHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SO
I WAS ABOUT TO DESCRIBE THE APPRENTICESHIP OF MY MANHOOD
SO I USE MY INCONTESTABLE RIGHT TO A CONFUSED STYLE BY INSERTING HERE IN THE WRONG PLACE ONE OF THE MANY INCOHERENT SHEETS WHICH I ONCE FILLED WITH RUBBISH
AND TRUE FEMININE HUMILITY THE MOST EXTREME SUFFERING IF IT IS ONLY SURROUNDED WITHOUT SEPARATING US
WOULD SEEM TO ME NOTHING BUT A CHARMING ANTITHESIS TO THE SUBLIME FRIVOLITY OF OUR MARRIAGE WHY SHOULD WE NOT TAKE THE HARSHEST WHIM OF CHANCE FOR AN EXCELLENT JEST AND A MOST FROLICSOME CAPRICE SINCE WE
EVEN AS THE WOMEN OF INDIA DO IMPELLED BY A MAD LAW THE CRUEL CONSTRAINING PURPOSE OF WHICH DESECRATES AND DESTROYS THE MOST DELICATE SANCTITIES OF THE WILL
I DID NOT THINK OF IT AS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE OR EVEN IN THE PRESENT EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY PAST FOR A LONG TIME YOU HAD BEEN WRAPT IN THE BOSOM OF THE COLD EARTH
NOW IT WAS LIKE THE TERRIBLE GLEAM OF VISIBLE OMNIPOTENCE NOW LIKE A SOFT RAY OF GOLDEN CHILDHOOD
THEN YOU APPEARED TO ME BECKONING WITH THE SUMMONS OF DEATH
AND I WARN YOU THAT THERE BE NONE OF YOU BUT HE BE WELL HORSED AND THAT YE ALL BE CLOTHED IN GREEN EITHER SILK OR CLOTH AND I SHALL BRING WITH ME TEN LADIES AND EVERY KNIGHT SHALL HAVE A LADY BEHIND HIM
THEN SIR LAUNCELOT WENT AWHILE AND HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY CUMBERED BY HIS ARMOR HIS SHIELD AND HIS SPEAR AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO HIM THEN BY CHANCE THERE CAME BY HIM A CART THAT CAME THITHER TO FETCH WOOD
AND WAS ABOUT TO KISS HER HAND WHEN SHE EXCLAIMED AH LAUNCELOT WHY DO I SEE THEE AGAIN YET FEEL THEE TO BE NO LONGER WORTHY OF ME AFTER HAVING BEEN DISGRACEFULLY DRAWN ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN A SHE HAD NOT TIME TO FINISH THE PHRASE
NOW ARTHUR AND HIS HOUSEHOLD WERE IN SEARCH OF PERCEVAL AND BY CHANCE THEY CAME THAT WAY KNOW YE SAID ARTHUR WHO IS THE KNIGHT WITH THE LONG SPEAR THAT STANDS BY THE BROOK UP YONDER LORD SAID ONE OF THEM
SURNAMED THE GOLDEN TONGUED BECAUSE HE WAS THE MOST COURTEOUS KNIGHT IN ARTHUR'S COURT IT IS NOT FITTING THAT ANY SHOULD DISTURB AN HONORABLE KNIGHT FROM HIS THOUGHT UNADVISEDLY FOR EITHER HE IS PONDERING SOME DAMAGE THAT HE HAS SUSTAINED
OR HE IS THINKING OF THE LADY WHOM BEST HE LOVES IF IT SEEM WELL TO THEE LORD I WILL GO AND SEE IF THIS KNIGHT HAS CHANGED FROM HIS THOUGHT AND IF HE HAS I WILL ASK HIM COURTEOUSLY TO COME AND VISIT THEE
AND THE KING'S FOOL FOOTNOTE A FOOL WAS A COMMON APPENDAGE OF THE COURTS OF THOSE DAYS WHEN THIS ROMANCE WAS WRITTEN A FOOL WAS THE ORNAMENT HELD IN NEXT ESTIMATION TO A DWARF HE WORE A WHITE DRESS WITH A YELLOW BONNET
AND CARRIED A BELL OR BAWBLE IN HIS HAND THOUGH CALLED A FOOL HIS WORDS WERE OFTEN WEIGHED AND REMEMBERED AS IF THERE WERE A SORT OF ORACULAR MEANING IN THEM
TILL SHE HAD SEEN HIM WHO WOULD BE THE FLOWER OF CHIVALRY NOW THIS DAMSEL CAME UP TO PERCEVAL AND TOLD HIM SMILING THAT IF HE LIVED HE WOULD BE ONE OF THE BRAVEST AND BEST OF KNIGHTS TRULY SAID KAY
THEREFORE WILL I GO TO SEE WHAT HAS BEFALLEN HIM SO SIR OWAIN WENT TO THE MEADOW AND HE FOUND PERCEVAL TRYING IN VAIN TO GET THE DEAD KNIGHT'S ARMOR OFF IN ORDER TO CLOTHE HIMSELF WITH IT
SIR OWAIN UNFASTENED THE ARMOR AND HELPED PERCEVAL TO PUT IT ON AND TAUGHT HIM HOW TO PUT HIS FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND USE THE SPUR
WITH MEEKNESS AND FEAR THEN RAISING HER EYES TO HIS FACE WITH A TOUCHING MIXTURE OF DEEP HUMILITY AND HOLY BOLDNESS SHE CONTINUED AND THIS SIR IS MY ANSWER JESUS SAYS HIM THAT COMETH UNTO ME I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT
AND HER FATHER'S VOICE SAID GOOD MORNING LITTLE DAUGHTER
WE WERE ALL SO SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE US SO SOON LAST NIGHT WE HAD LOTS OF FUN AFTER YOU LEFT I THINK YOUR PAPA MIGHT HAVE LET YOU STAY UP A LITTLE LONGER BUT HE HAS PROMISED THAT TONIGHT AS WE ARE TO HAVE THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND EVER SO MUCH WILL BE GOING ON
HER BLUE EYES OPENED WIDE WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN ELSIE QUIETLY REPLIED THAT HER PAPA HAD KINDLY ARRANGED TO GIVE HER AN HOUR EVERY MORNING
BUT NO ONE WAS MORE DELIGHTED TO MEET ELSIE THAN HERBERT AND SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO LEARN THAT HIS HEALTH WAS GRADUALLY IMPROVING HE WAS NOT HOWEVER AT ALL STRONG EVEN YET AND HIS MOTHER THOUGHT IT BEST FOR HIM TO LIE DOWN AND REST A LITTLE AFTER HIS RIDE
SO FINE AND SOFT AND GLOSSY SUCH A BEAUTIFUL COLOR TOO
VERY SWEET LITTLE GIRL I AM SURE AND I SHALL LOVE YOU DEARLY SHE SAID KISSING HER SEVERAL TIMES AH I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING IF I HAD SUCH A CLEAR FAIR COMPLEXION AND SUCH ROSY CHEEKS THAT MAKES YOU BLUSH WELL I LIKE TO SEE IT
BUT HAD IT NOT LUCY WHO WAS STANDING AT THE WINDOW TURNED QUICKLY ROUND COME GIRLS SHE SAID LET US RUN OUT AND SEE THEM OFF THEY'RE BRINGING UP THE HORSES
AND SET HER DOWN THE LITTLE GIRLS WATCHED UNTIL THE LAST OF THE PARTY HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN THE AVENUE AND THEN RAN GAYLY UP STAIRS TO ELSIE'S ROOM WHERE THEY BUSIED THEMSELVES UNTIL TEA TIME IN VARIOUS LITTLE PREPARATIONS FOR THE EVENING
AND ALMOST EVERY ONE HAD SEVERAL PRETTY PRESENTS MARY LESLIE AND LITTLE FLORA ARNOTT WERE MADE PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH WAX DOLLS THAT COULD OPEN AND SHUT THEIR EYES CAROLINE HOWARD RECEIVED A GOLD CHAIN FROM HER MAMMA AND A PRETTY PIN FROM ELSIE
QUICK MART I SHOUTED UP THE SHATTERED STAIRWAY WE CAN GET THROUGH THE HOLLOW RUTH AND DRAKE ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE BREAK WE CAME THROUGH HURRY ALL RIGHT JUST A MINUTE HE CALLED I HEARD HIM EMPTY HIS MAGAZINE WITH ALMOST MACHINE GUN QUICKNESS
WE DROPPED UPON OUR KNEES SENT SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO THEM THEY FELL BACK HESITATED WE SPRANG UP SPED ON ALL TOO SHORT WAS THE CHECK BUT ONCE MORE WE HELD THEM AND AGAIN NOW RUTH AND DICK WERE A SCANT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE CREVICE I SAW HIM STOP
BEFORE THE CRY HAD CEASED THERE POURED WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS OUT OF THE CREVICE SCORE UPON SCORE OF THE METAL THINGS THE FISSURES VOMITED THEM
GLOBES AND CUBES AND PYRAMIDS NOT SMALL LIKE THOSE OF THE RUINS BUT SHAPES ALL OF FOUR FEET HIGH DULLY LUSTROUS AND DEEP WITHIN THAT LUSTER THE MYRIADS OF TINY POINTS OF LIGHT LIKE UNWINKING STARING EYES
THEY SLICED INTO THE CLOSE PACKED FORWARD RANKS OF THE ARMORED MEN CUT OUT OF THEM TWO GREAT GAPS SICKENED I SAW FRAGMENTS OF MAN AND HORSE FLY ANOTHER ARM JAVELINED FROM ITS PLACE LIKE A FLYING SNAKE CLICKED AT THE END OF ANOTHER
THEY SCATTERED RUNNING SINGLY BY TWOS IN LITTLE GROUPS FOR THE SIDES OF THE VALLEY THEY WERE LIKE RATS SCAMPERING IN PANIC OVER THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT GREEN BOWL AND LIKE A MONSTROUS CAT THE SHAPE PLAYED WITH THEM YES PLAYED
IN THIS WORLD OF OURS TWENTY CENTURIES BEYOND THEIR TIME SWIFTLY ACCURATELY EVEN AS I SCANNED THEM WE HAD BEEN DRILLING INTO THEM THEY ADVANCED DELIBERATELY HEEDLESS OF THEIR FALLEN THEIR ARROWS HAD CEASED TO FLY
WE LEAPED TO OUR FEET SENT OUR LAST BULLETS INTO THEM STOOD READY RIFLES CLUBBED TO MEET THE RUSH I HEARD RUTH SCREAM WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE ARMORED MEN WHY HAD THEY HALTED
WITH THE THREE LONG PRONGS OF THIS TRIDENT THE THING STRUCK SWIFTLY
AT THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE STOOD THE WOMAN HER GAZE RESTING UPON DRAKE HIS ARMS ABOUT RUTH HER HEAD HIDDEN ON HIS BREAST THE VALLEY WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR THE HUDDLED HEAPS THAT DOTTED IT
STOOD FOR AN INSTANT AT THE BRINK OF THE GREEN FOREST THERE CAME TO US AS THOUGH FROM IMMEASURABLE DISTANCES A FAINT SUSTAINED THRUMMING LIKE THE BEATING OF COUNTLESS MUFFLED DRUMS THE THING THAT CARRIED US TREMBLED THE SOUND DIED AWAY
THE THING QUIETED IT BEGAN ITS STEADY EFFORTLESS STRIDING THROUGH THE CROWDING TREES BUT NOW WITH NONE OF THAT SPEED WITH WHICH IT HAD COME SPURRED FORWARD BY NORHALA'S AWAKENED HATE VENTNOR STIRRED
REVELATIONS I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL THEM AND THOUGH EACH SEEMED EQUALLY REAL OF TWO OF THEM ONLY ONE I THINK CAN BE TRUE AND OF THE THIRD THAT MAY SOME TIME BE TRUE BUT SURELY IS NOT YET THROUGH THE AIR CAME A LOUDER DRUM ROLL
IT LOOKED PLEASANT TO ME VERY PLEASANT SO LONG A TIME HAD ELAPSED SINCE I HAD SEEN A GARDEN OF ANY SORT
WHO IS A MARRIED MAN OF NEAR FIFTY I REMARKED THAT I HOPED SHE WOULD FIND ME WORTHY OF HER GOOD OPINION THAT IF I KNEW MYSELF I WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ANY CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN ME DU RESTE SAID SHE
AND WHEN SHE COULD NOT GET ME TO NAME A SUM SHE REASONED AND REASONED WITH A FLUENT YET QUIET CIRCUMLOCUTION OF SPEECH AND AT LAST NAILED ME DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER ANNUM NOT TOO MUCH BUT I AGREED
ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN THE TWILIGHT SOFTENED HER FEATURES A LITTLE AND IN THE DOUBTFUL DUSK I COULD FANCY HER FOREHEAD AS OPEN AS IT WAS REALLY ELEVATED HER MOUTH TOUCHED WITH TURNS OF SWEETNESS AS WELL AS DEFINED IN LINES OF SENSE
AND HAD BROUGHT BACK WONDERFUL STORIES OF THAT OUTER WORLD AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER GO INTO IT AND SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT WAS THERE WITH THE THOUGHT SHE ROSE SLOWLY TO HER FEET
THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN LIKE THAT BEFORE HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH AND LOOKED DIFFERENT AS DID HIS THROAT AND HIS HANDS HIS BREECHES WERE TIGHT
SHE SAW HANGING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SADDLE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN HE WAS A RAIDER THAT MAN SO CAUTIOUSLY AND SWIFTLY THEN SHE PUSHED HERSELF BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
THE GIRL SHRANK TO THE BUSHES BUT SHE CRIED SHARPLY BACK DON'T YOU HURT HIM NOW DAD HE AIN'T EVEN GOT A PISTOL HE AIN'T NO SHET UP
HALE SMILED HE LOVED OLD PEOPLE AND TWO KINDER FACES HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO GENTLER VOICES HE HAD NEVER HEARD
HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY A LONG CRY CAME DOWN THE RAVINE
HAVE YOU GOT A FATHER LIKE A FLASH HER WHOLE FACE CHANGED
THEN HE LOOKED UP FOR AN INSTANT HE SEEMED TERRIFIED BUT HE DID NOT RUN INSTEAD HE STEALTHILY SHIFTED THE PINE DAGGER OVER TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE STRING TO HIS LEFT HERE BOY SAID THE FISHERMAN WITH AFFECTED STERNNESS
NEAR THE BANK SEGOUIN DREW UP AND JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND ALIGHTED A LITTLE KNOT OF PEOPLE COLLECTED ON THE FOOTPATH TO PAY HOMAGE TO THE SNORTING MOTOR THE PARTY WAS TO DINE TOGETHER THAT EVENING IN SEGOUIN'S HOTEL AND MEANWHILE JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND WHO WAS STAYING WITH HIM
THE CARS OF THEIR FRIENDS THE FRENCH THE FRENCH MOREOVER WERE VIRTUAL VICTORS THEIR TEAM HAD FINISHED SOLIDLY THEY HAD BEEN PLACED SECOND AND THIRD AND THE DRIVER OF THE WINNING GERMAN CAR WAS REPORTED A BELGIAN
HIS FATHER WHO HAD BEGUN LIFE AS AN ADVANCED NATIONALIST HAD MODIFIED HIS VIEWS EARLY HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY AS A BUTCHER IN KINGSTOWN AND BY OPENING SHOPS IN DUBLIN AND IN THE SUBURBS HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY MANY TIMES OVER
DECIDEDLY VILLONA WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS HE KEPT UP A DEEP BASS HUM OF MELODY FOR MILES OF THE ROAD THE FRENCHMEN FLUNG THEIR LAUGHTER AND LIGHT WORDS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND OFTEN JIMMY HAD TO STRAIN FORWARD TO CATCH THE QUICK PHRASE
AT THE CONTROL SEGOUIN HAD PRESENTED HIM TO ONE OF THE FRENCH COMPETITORS AND IN ANSWER TO HIS CONFUSED MURMUR OF COMPLIMENT THE SWARTHY FACE OF THE DRIVER HAD DISCLOSED A LINE OF SHINING WHITE TEETH
AND AS HE STOOD IN THE HALL GIVING A LAST EQUATION TO THE BOWS OF HIS DRESS TIE HIS FATHER MAY HAVE FELT EVEN COMMERCIALLY SATISFIED AT HAVING SECURED FOR HIS SON QUALITIES OFTEN UNPURCHASEABLE HIS FATHER THEREFORE WAS UNUSUALLY FRIENDLY WITH VILLONA
VILLONA SAID WITH CONVICTION IT IS DELIGHTFUL THERE WAS A YACHT PIANO IN THE CABIN VILLONA PLAYED A WALTZ FOR FARLEY AND RIVIERE FARLEY ACTING AS CAVALIER AND RIVIERE AS LADY
I HOPE SO HIS NAME WILL GIVE TONE AND STRENGTH TO IT I KNEW YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SHOW HIM THAT IT WAS JUST AND PURE IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS CORDIAL SUPPORT I THINK I CONVINCED HIM YES I AM PERFECTLY SURE HE WILL VOTE RIGHT NOW
I SUPPOSE HE WILL PAINT PUB DOCS ON THEM AND FRANK THEM HOME THAT'S GOOD ECONOMY ISN'T IT YES YES BUT CHILD ALL CONGRESSMEN DO THAT IT MAY NOT BE STRICTLY HONEST INDEED IT IS NOT UNLESS HE HAD SOME PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MIXED IN WITH THE CLOTHES
IT'S A FUNNY WORLD GOOD BYE UNCLE I'M GOING TO SEE THAT CHAIRMAN AND HUMMING A CHEERY OPERA AIR SHE DEPARTED TO HER ROOM TO DRESS FOR GOING OUT BEFORE SHE DID THAT HOWEVER SHE TOOK OUT HER NOTE BOOK AND WAS SOON DEEP IN ITS CONTENTS MARKING DASHING
AND MORE THAN SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO TELL HIM SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY THIS TIME WITH A GOOD MANY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS OF NEWSPAPER ROW AND EXCHANGED GOSSIP WITH THEM TO THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE
THAT IS TO SAY HE CHARGED NOTHING MORE THAN THE LUMBER WOULD BRING BUT THE POOR INJUNS NOT THAT I CARE MUCH FOR INJUNS WHAT DID HE DO FOR THEM GAVE THEM THE OUTSIDE SLABS TO FENCE IN THE RESERVATION WITH GOVERNOR BALLOON WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FATHER TO THE POOR INDIANS BUT BALLOON IS NOT ALONE
LORENZO AS WE HAVE SAID WAS AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF SAVONAROLA WITH AN IMPATIENCE MIXED WITH UNEASINESS SO THAT WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS STEPS HIS PALE FACE TOOK A YET MORE DEATHLIKE TINGE
HE REPLIED WITH A GROAN WHICH PROVED THE MONK'S MEMORY TO BE ONLY TOO TRUE THEN AT LAST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LORENZO ASKED IN A DOUBTFUL TONE THEN DO YOU BELIEVE MY FATHER THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE ME EVERYTHING BOTH MY SINS AND MY CRIMES
MY FATHER SHALL I HAVE TIME ASKED THE DYING MAN GOD WILL GIVE IT TO YOU REPLIED THE MONK
IT IS NOT I WHO DESIRE IT IT IS THE LORD REPLIED SAVONAROLA COLDLY IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE MURMURED LORENZO VERY WELL THEN DIE AS YOU HAVE LIVED CRIED THE MONK IN THE MIDST OF YOUR COURTIERS AND FLATTERERS
FIRST I HAD THE BEST BUFFALO HORSE THAT EVER MADE A TRACK AND SECOND I WAS USING WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE NEEDLE GUN A BREECH LOADING SPRINGFIELD RIFLE CALIBRE FIFTY IT WAS MY FAVORITE OLD LUCRETIA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF THE READER
AND WHICH PROVED A GOOD DRINK ON A KANSAS PRAIRIE AND A BUFFALO HUNTER WAS A GOOD MAN TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHILE TAKING A SHORT REST WE SUDDENLY SPIED ANOTHER HERD OF BUFFALOES COMING TOWARD US IT WAS ONLY A SMALL DROVE AND WE AT ONCE PREPARED TO GIVE THE ANIMALS A LIVELY RECEPTION
HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE INDIANS WHO OVERTOOK HIM AND HIS COMPANION WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT HALF A MILE AFTER SURROUNDING THE TWO MEN THEY SUDDENLY ATTACKED THEM THEY KILLED SCALPED AND ROBBED COMSTOCK BUT GROVER ALTHOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED MADE HIS ESCAPE
AS SCOUTS AND GUIDES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND I CONCLUDED ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP MY OLD AVOCATION OF SCOUTING AND GUIDING FOR THE ARMY HAVING NO SUITABLE PLACE IN WHICH TO LEAVE MY OLD AND FAITHFUL BUFFALO HUNTER BRIGHAM AND NOT WISHING TO KILL HIM BY SCOUTING
I DETERMINED TO DISPOSE OF HIM I WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO PART WITH HIM BUT I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO RECEIVE HARDER USAGE IN OTHER HANDS THAN HE HAD IN MINE I HAD SEVERAL GOOD OFFERS TO SELL HIM
AND WHENEVER I AGAIN VISIT MEMPHIS I SHALL SURELY GO AND SEE BRIGHAM IF HE IS STILL ALIVE BUT TO RETURN TO THE THREAD OF MY NARRATIVE FROM WHICH I HAVE WANDERED
HE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ME AND INSISTED ON MY BECOMING HIS GUEST HE WOULD LISTEN TO NO EXCUSES AND ON INTRODUCING ME TO MESSRS OVERTON AND BLAIR PROPRIETORS OF THE BREVOORT THEY ALSO GAVE ME A PRESSING INVITATION TO MAKE MY HOME AT THEIR HOUSE
I FOUND I HAD ACCEPTED INVITATIONS TO DINE AT HALF A DOZEN OR MORE HOUSES ON THE SAME DAY AND AT THE SAME HOUR JAMES GORDON BENNETT HAD PREPARED A DINNER FOR ME AT WHICH QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF HIS FRIENDS WERE TO BE PRESENT
I MET HIM SOON AFTER HE GOT INTO TOWN IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION HOW I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF I REPLIED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE BEST CAMP I HAD EVER SEEN AND IF HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ABOUT TEN DAYS
NOW MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S NOSE WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE UNTO THE NOSES OF ALL THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHOM PANTAGRUEL FOUND DWELLING UPON THE ISLAND OF ENNASIN
DID HE READ SUCH BOOKS AND OBSERVE SUCH FACTS AND THINK SUCH THOUGHTS AS WOULD ETERNALLY BE MAKING HIM CHANGE SIDES NOW MY FATHER AS I TOLD YOU LAST YEAR DETESTED ALL THIS HE PICK'D UP AN OPINION SIR
THE APPLE IS AS MUCH FRANK'S APPLE AS JOHN'S PRAY MISTER SHANDY WHAT PATENT HAS HE TO SHEW FOR IT AND HOW DID IT BEGIN TO BE HIS WAS IT WHEN HE SET HIS HEART UPON IT OR WHEN HE GATHERED IT
THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FOR THEE WHICH OCCURS TO ME AT PRESENT UNLESS THE BREAKING OUT OF A FRESH WAR SO WISHING EVERY THING DEAR TOBY FOR BEST I REST THY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER WALTER SHANDY
BUT THE ACCOUNT OF THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN TO BE WOVE INTO THE FAG END OF THE EIGHTH ALLUDING TO THE FIRST EDITION VOLUME OF SUCH A WORK AS THIS
TWOULD HAVE COST HER LADYSHIP A SMILE IT CURL'D EVERY WHERE BUT WHERE THE CORPORAL WOULD HAVE IT AND WHERE A BUCKLE OR TWO IN HIS OPINION WOULD HAVE DONE IT HONOUR HE COULD AS SOON HAVE RAISED THE DEAD
YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL KNOWS OF TOM'S MISFORTUNES BUT THIS AFFAIR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM ANY FURTHER THAN THIS
WAS DIFFICULT TO BE MET WITH AT WATERING PLACES WHICH WERE ALREADY PREOCCUPIED WITH ABUNDANCE OF ANGLING BEAUTIES AND WERE CHIEFLY STOCKED WITH MEN WHOSE WHISKERS MIGHT BE DYED AND WHOSE INCOMES WERE STILL MORE PROBLEMATIC
THE COUNTESS DID NOT QUOTE SOPHOCLES BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT OF PRETENCE AND VANITY AND THEN I WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND MAKE MYSELF QUITE SAFE FOR ANOTHER WORLD
NOW THERE WAS BY CHANCE NOBODY ELSE AT HAND THAT MIGHT SEIZE UPON THESE MEN AND FOR HEROD HE WAS CONTENTED TO HAVE COME TO NO HARM HIMSELF SO THAT THEY ALL GOT AWAY IN SAFETY EIGHT
WHO WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS BROTHER AND SENDS THAT HEAD TO HIS OTHER BROTHER PHERORAS
ACQUAINTANCE AT THE WORKS BUT HE WENT HIMSELF TO SAMARIA TO TAKE THE DAUGHTER OF ALEXANDER THE SON OF ARISTOBULUS TO WIFE WHO HAD BEEN BETROTHED TO HIM BEFORE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
AND THESE PARTICULARLY PLUNDERED THE PLACES THAT WERE ABOUT THE CITY AND THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FOOD LEFT EITHER FOR THE HORSES OR THE MEN YET SOME OF THE WARLIKE MEN WHO WERE USED TO FIGHT REGULARLY WERE APPOINTED TO DEFEND THE CITY DURING THE SIEGE
NOW AS FOR THE ROBBERIES WHICH WERE COMMITTED THE KING CONTRIVED THAT AMBUSHES SHOULD BE SO LAID THAT THEY MIGHT RESTRAIN THEIR EXCURSIONS AND AS FOR THE WANT OF PROVISIONS HE PROVIDED THAT THEY SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THEM FROM GREAT DISTANCES
BUT THROUGH THEIR MINES UNDER GROUND THEY WOULD APPEAR IN THE MIDST OF THEM ON THE SUDDEN AND BEFORE THEY COULD BATTER DOWN ONE WALL THEY BUILT THEM ANOTHER IN ITS STEAD AND TO SUM UP ALL AT ONCE
HE ALSO FORBADE AT THE SAME TIME THE SPOILING OF THE CITY ASKING SOSIUS IN THE MOST EARNEST MANNER WHETHER THE ROMANS BY THUS EMPTYING THE CITY OF MONEY AND MEN HAD A MIND TO LEAVE HIM KING OF A DESERT
LEADING ANTIGONUS AWAY IN BONDS TO ANTONY THEN DID THE AXE BRING HIM TO HIS END
MINISTRANT ARS ET NATURA INSTILLANT THEY USE CORDIALS TO KEEP THE VENOM AND MALIGNITY OF THE DISEASE FROM THE HEART ELEVEN MEDITATION
WHENCE CAN WE TAKE A BETTER ARGUMENT A CLEARER DEMONSTRATION THAT ALL THE GREATNESS OF THIS WORLD IS BUILT UPON OPINION OF OTHERS AND HATH IN ITSELF NO REAL BEING NOR POWER OF SUBSISTENCE
THIS SICK THIS DISEASEFUL WORLD AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS LEPROUS HOUSE THIS FLESH OF MINE THIS HEART THOUGH THUS PREPARED FOR THEE PREPARED BY THEE
THOUGH THOU FILLEST ALL YET ART OTHERWISE IN SOME ROOMS THEREOF THAN IN OTHERS OTHERWISE IN THY CHURCH THAN IN MY CHAMBER AND OTHERWISE IN THY SACRAMENTS THAN IN MY PRAYERS
ART ABLE TO MAKE THIS PRESENT SICKNESS EVERLASTING HEALTH THIS WEAKNESS EVERLASTING STRENGTH AND THIS VERY DEJECTION AND FAINTNESS OF HEART A POWERFUL CORDIAL
THAT WHEN THOU HAST CATECHISED ME WITH AFFLICTION HERE I MAY TAKE A GREATER DEGREE AND SERVE THEE IN A HIGHER PLACE IN THY KINGDOM OF JOY AND GLORY
MY FATHER WAS AND STILL IS RECEVEUR GENERAL AT C HE HAS A GREAT REPUTATION THERE FOR LOYALTY THANKS TO WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO FIND THE SECURITY WHICH HE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THIS POSITION
ALWAYS REPEATING THAT I WAS QUITE WELL AND THAT I WAS NOT IN NEED OF MONEY TWO THINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD CONSOLE MY FATHER FOR MY DELAY IN PAYING HIM MY ANNUAL VISIT JUST THEN ONE FINE DAY IN SUMMER
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCEPT IT SAVE FROM ONE MAN LET ME ALONE BIG BABY AND SAY NOTHING THAT MEANS SAID PRUDENCE THAT WHEN I HAVE TWO DAYS FREE I WILL COME AND SPEND THEM WITH YOU
WHERE THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN RIGOUR IN REGARD TO PAYMENTS ONE IS ALMOST CERTAIN THE MOMENT ONE GAINS A CONSIDERABLE SUM NOT TO RECEIVE IT YOU WILL READILY UNDERSTAND WHY GAMBLING IS ONLY LIKELY TO BE CARRIED ON BY YOUNG PEOPLE
VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES
IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN LOVE YOU MUST HAVE FELT THE NEED OF ISOLATING FROM THIS WORLD THE BEING IN WHOM YOU WOULD LIVE WHOLLY IT SEEMS AS IF HOWEVER INDIFFERENT SHE MAY BE TO HER SURROUNDINGS THE WOMAN WHOM ONE LOVES LOSES SOMETHING OF HER PERFUME
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK TO ARMAND MARGUERITE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SHE ANSWERED NOTHING MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY WHILE I WAITED FOR HER REPLY NO SHE ANSWERED I WILL NOT LEAVE ARMAND
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
HE WOULD BRING HER BACK TO HIM BUT WHEN HE HAD PERCEIVED THE USELESSNESS OF THESE MEANS HE COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
CLUNG TO HER MOTHER WITH ONE HAND AND WITH THE OTHER PRESSED CLOSE TO HER LITTLE BOSOM THE ENGLISH HISTORY IN HER ALL ABSORBING FEAR SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO LAY IT DOWN
AND WITH THESE BRAVE FELLOWS I'LL TAKE HER ROUND THE WORLD THE TOUCH OF BOMBAST WAS NOT OUT OF PLACE IT JUMPED SO FAR WITH THE HUMOUR OF THE CONVICTS THAT THEY SET UP A FEEBLE CHEER AT WHICH SYLVIA FROWNED
FRIGHTENED AS SHE WAS THE PRISON BRED CHILD WAS AS MUCH ASTONISHED AT HEARING CONVICTS CHEER AS A FASHIONABLE LADY WOULD BE TO HEAR HER FOOTMAN QUOTE POETRY BATES HOWEVER PRACTICAL AND CALM TOOK QUITE ANOTHER VIEW OF THE CASE
HE HAD FEARED THAT THE CHILD WAS INJURED BY THE DIRECTION OF REX THE WHALE BOAT WAS BROUGHT ALONGSIDE THE JOLLY BOAT AND CHESHIRE AND LESLY BOARDED HER
SYLVIA SAID NOTHING AND SEEMED TO SHRINK FROM THE LIEUTENANT PERHAPS IN HER CHILDISH FANCY SHE HAD PICTURED HIM AS COMING TO HER RESCUE
GO WITH HIM YE BEGGARS SAID HE AND LEAVE US HONEST MEN OH YE'LL GET A TYING UP FOR THIS THE PHRASE TYING UP BROUGHT WITH IT RECOLLECTION OF THE WORST PORTION OF MILITARY DISCIPLINE THE CAT
AND OF NECESSITY DEPRIVED OF ALL RATIONAL RECREATION WHILE PUNISHMENT FOR OFFENCES WAS PROMPT AND SEVERE THE COMPANIES DRAFTED TO THE PENAL SETTLEMENTS WERE NOT COMPOSED OF THE BEST MATERIAL AND THE PAIR HAD GOOD PRECEDENT FOR THE COURSE THEY WERE ABOUT TO TAKE
AND BURGESS FOR SOME MINUTES PULLED ALMOST AT RANDOM IN PURSUIT THE SAME TREMENDOUS FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHICH HAD SAVED THE LIFE OF MC NAB BY CAUSING REX TO MISS HIS AIM SHOWED TO THE COMMANDANT THE WHALE BOAT BALANCED ON THE SUMMIT OF AN ENORMOUS WAVE
AND APPARENTLY ABOUT TO BE FLUNG AGAINST THE WALL OF ROCK WHICH MAGNIFIED IN THE FLASH SEEMED FRIGHTFULLY NEAR TO THEM THE NEXT INSTANT BURGESS HIMSELF HIS BOAT LIFTED BY THE SWIFTLY ADVANCING BILLOW
FLOATING IN A POOL OF INK THE GREAT CLIFF WHOSE EVERY SCAR AND CRAG WAS AS DISTINCT AS THOUGH ITS HUGE BULK WAS BUT A YARD DISTANT SEEMED TO SHOOT OUT FROM ITS BASE TOWARDS THE STRUGGLING INSECT A BROAD FLAT STRAW THAT WAS A STRIP OF DRY LAND
IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE MAN FOR WHOM HE WAS SEARCHING HAD NOT BEEN RETAKEN AND WAS EVEN NOW AWAITING HIS ARRIVAL IT WAS CLEARLY HIS DUTY HEARING OF THE PLANNED ESCAPE HAVING BEEN ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED NOT TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHILE HOPE REMAINED
BLUNT HAD NOT CHOSEN MEN WHO WERE LIKELY TO BETRAY HIM THOUGH FOR THAT MATTER REX HAD SUGGESTED A PRECAUTION WHICH RENDERED BETRAYAL ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
AND THIS ISTHMUS OF THE GUARDED NECK WAS HIDDEN BY THE OUTLYING CLIFF IN THE SOUTH WESTERN ANGLE OF THIS CLIFF ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN THE SUMMIT AND THE SEA WAS AN ARCH WHICH VOMITED A RED AND FLICKERING LIGHT THAT FAINTLY SHONE UPON THE SEA IN THE TRACK OF THE BOAT
AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
AND A FARM WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AGAIN WE SET ABOUT SEARCHING FOR CLAIMS AND THE MORE WE SEARCHED THE LESS WE LIKED THE LOOK OF THINGS FINALLY ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER A LONG WEARISOME TRAMP WE CAST OFF AT HIGH TIDE
DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
IT EXTENDED AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING THE SOUND INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE ROAR OF A HEAVY FALL OF RAIN OR HAIL ON WATER AND WE BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS A VAST SCHOOL OF FISH MOVING SOUTH
I SAW STUFF THEY CALLED BUTTER SELL FOR THAT POTATOES ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS A BUSHEL AND ONIONS AT FOUR EVERYTHING THE FARMER RAISES SELLS HIGH WHO BUYS OH ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WERE MET UNTIL I REACHED THE MAIN TRAVELED ROUTE BEYOND THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE ROAD LAY THROUGH A FORBIDDING SAGE PLAIN OR RATHER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY COVERED BY SHIFTING SANDS
AND COMPELLED ME TO LEAVE THE ROAD AND DESCEND INTO THE VALLEY FOR WATER
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS HOBBLES HAD BECOME LOOSENED GIVING HIM FREE USE OF ALL HIS FEET AND HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO TAKE THE TRAIL AGAIN COAXING WAS OF NO AVAIL DRIVING WOULD DO NO GOOD
THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
SHE WAS NOT THERE MONTHS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE SANDS OF THE PLATTE VALLEY MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO LAY BURIED ON THE PLAINS NEAR INDEPENDENCE ROCK
DO YOU SAY THAT WE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIPS THAT DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF VIEW AS TO THIS RETURN TRIP I CAN TRULY SAY FOR MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONE OF HARDSHIP I ENJOYED OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES AND SO DID THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE COMPANY
ILL HEALTH FORCED HIM TO RELINQUISH HIS COMMISSION EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR AND UNTIL HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WAS A LEADING CITIZEN OF THE COUNTY JUDGE AUGUSTUS H FENN MAJOR AND BREVET COLONEL
THOUGH THE LARGE ADDITION TO ITS NUMBERS WHICH THE INCREASE IN SIZE NECESSITATED MADE IT PERHAPS SOMEWHAT LESS HOMOGENEOUS THAN AT FIRST IT DID NOT GREATLY ALTER ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
EAGLES FOR INSTANCE INSTEAD OF BROADLY SPEAKING FROM APE LIKE OR MONKEYISH BEINGS BEING OF SIMIAN STOCK WE HAD SIMIAN TRAITS OUR DEVELOPMENT NATURALLY BORE THE MARKS OF OUR ORIGIN
BY VIRTUE OF WHICH EVERY LIVING THING GROWS AND DEVELOPS AND IT TENDS TOWARD SPLENDOR SEEDS BECOME TREES AND WEAK LITTLE NATIONS GROW GREAT BUT THE PUSH OR THE FORCE THAT IS DOING THIS THE YEAST AS IT WERE
HAS TO WORK IN AND ON CERTAIN DEFINITE KINDS OF MATERIAL BECAUSE THIS YEAST IS IN US THERE MAY BE GREAT AND UNDREAMED OF POSSIBILITIES AWAITING MANKIND BUT BECAUSE OF OUR LINE OF DESCENT
AND KEPT US IN CAGES OR SHOW US FOR SPORT IN THE FOREST WHILE THEY RULED THE WORLD SO POTTER AND I DEVELOPING THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT BEGAN TO IMAGINE WE HAD LIVED MANY AGES AGO AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER HAD ALIGHTED HERE FROM SOME OLDER PLANET
STILL THOSE FROWSY UNLOVELY HORDES OF APES AND MONKEYS WERE SO COMPLETELY LACKING IN SIGNS OF KINGSHIP THEY WERE SO FLIGHTY TOO IN THEIR WAYS AND HAD SO LITTLE PURPOSE AND SO MUCH LOVE FOR ABSURD AND IDLE CHATTER
IN A CIVILIZATION OF SUPER ANTS OR BEES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROBLEM OF THE HUNGRY UNEMPLOYED NO POVERTY NO UNSTABLE GOVERNMENT NO RIOTS NO STRIKES FOR SHORT HOURS
RAIDS FEROCIOUS COMBATS AND LOOT ARE PART OF AN ANT'S REGULAR LIFE ANT REFORMERS IF THERE WERE ANY MIGHT LAY THIS TO THEIR PROPERTY SENSE AND TALK OF ABOLISHING PROPERTY AS A CURE FOR THE EVIL
WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE THEREWITH TO RULE THEIR INSTINCTS OR TO STOP WORK LONG ENOUGH TO EXAMINE THEMSELVES OR THE UNIVERSE OR TO DREAM OF ANY NOBLE DEVELOPMENT PROBABLY NOT REASON IS SELDOM OR NEVER THE RULER
WHEN ONE OF US CONQUERING MONKEY MEN ENTERS THE WOODS MOST ANIMALS THAT SCENT HIM SLINK AWAY OR RACE OFF IN A PANIC IT IS NOT THAT WE HAVE PLANNED THIS DELIBERATELY BUT THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE LIKE RACE BY RACE THEY HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED
DOGS HAVE MORE LOVE THAN INTEGRITY THEY'VE BEEN TRUE TO US YES BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRUE TO THEMSELVES PIGS THE PIG IS REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT AND BRAVE BUT HE'S GROSS
SAGACIOUS BOLD AND RESTLESS HE PUSHED HIS WAY FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND PRETENDED TO HAVE REACHED THE MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAINS OF APPALACHE HE SENT TO THE FORT MANTLES WOVEN WITH FEATHERS QUIVERS COVERED WITH CHOICE FURS
A HUMBLER ADVENTURER WAS PIERRE GAMBIE A ROBUST AND DARING YOUTH
FILLED WITH TREASURE GATHERED FROM SPANISH WRECKS ON ADJACENT REEFS AND KEYS THE MONARCH WAS A PRIEST TOO AND A MAGICIAN WITH POWER OVER THE ELEMENTS EACH YEAR HE WITHDREW FROM THE PUBLIC GAZE
FOR WITHIN THE PRECINCT OF FORT CAROLINE A HOMESICK SQUALID BAND DEJECTED AND WORN DRAGGED THEIR SHRUNKEN LIMBS ABOUT THE SUN SCORCHED AREA OR LAY STRETCHED IN LISTLESS WRETCHEDNESS UNDER THE SHADE OF THE BARRACKS
HE KNEW THAT MANY VOTES HAD BEEN GIVEN FOR BROWBOROUGH WHICH IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN OF THEM WOULD BE KNOCKED OFF AND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF ANY ONE OF THOSE BY WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUPPORTED
HE MUST VANISH OUT OF THE WORLD
IF HE'D DRINK IT WHICH HE NEVER DOES I THINK I'D BEAR IT BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO THAT NASTY UNION AND YOUNG JACK WRITES AS WELL AS HIS FATHER PRETTY NIGH MISTER FINN WHICH IS A COMFORT MISTER BUNCE WAS A JOURNEYMAN SCRIVENER AT A LAW STATIONER'S
ALAS ALAS HOW SOON MIGHT HE NOW REQUIRE THAT MONEY LENDER'S SERVICES AND THEN HE RECOLLECTED HOW HE HAD LEFT THESE ROOMS TO GO INTO OTHERS GRANDER AND MORE APPROPRIATE TO HIS LIFE WHEN HE HAD FILLED HIGH OFFICE UNDER THE STATE
AS THE ART IS REAL SHE TOLD ME HOW POOR DEAR LADY BALDOCK COMMUNICATED TO YOU HER UNHAPPINESS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER IN A MANNER THAT MADE EVEN ME LAUGH AND WOULD MAKE THOUSANDS LAUGH IN DAYS TO COME WERE IT EVER TO BE PUBLISHED
THERE IS NO ONE WHOM I CAN ASK TO TELL ME OF HIM THAT HE DID NOT ATTEND DURING THE LAST SESSION I DO KNOW AND WE PRESUME THAT HE HAS NOW ABANDONED HIS SEAT I FEAR THAT HIS HEALTH IS BAD
THENCE OUGHT TO WEIGH UPON ME HE HAS NEVER EVEN TOLD ME THAT HE LOVES ME BUT HE IS PERSISTENT IN DECLARING THAT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS JOINED TOGETHER NOTHING HUMAN SHOULD SEPARATE
I HAVE TOLD PAPA THAT I SHOULD ASK YOU AND HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED
THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY SHE RECALLED HER PAST KINDNESS THE KINDNESS THE AFFECTION OF SIXTEEN YEARS HOW SHE HAD TAUGHT AND HOW SHE HAD PLAYED WITH HER FROM FIVE YEARS OLD
WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
BEING SETTLED IN LONDON ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY REACH
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER
IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO AND TO HAVE IT TAKE PLACE AND BE PROVED IN THE RIGHT
AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF THAN GOOD TO THEM BY INTERFERENCE
UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART BUT MY DEAR PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES THEY ARE SILLY THINGS AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY
BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
AND SOCIAL TEMPER BY ENTERING INTO THE MILITIA OF HIS COUNTY THEN EMBODIED CAPTAIN WESTON WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE AND WHEN THE CHANCES OF HIS MILITARY LIFE HAD INTRODUCED HIM TO MISS CHURCHILL OF A GREAT YORKSHIRE FAMILY
AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MISTER WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH AND SAYING AH POOR MISS TAYLOR SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY
MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM
HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT
MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
BUT VIRGINIA WHAT A WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF GOOD CAN BE DONE WITH THIS MONEY AND THE SALOON CANNOT ALWAYS REMAIN HERE THE TIME MUST COME WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FORCES IN THE CITY WILL TRIUMPH VIRGINIA PAUSED NEAR RACHEL AND HER PALE EARNEST FACE LIGHTED UP
YOU SHALL HAVE THE BEST OF MATERIAL IN THE WAY OF ORGANS AND ORCHESTRAS THAT MONEY CAN PROVIDE AND WHAT CANNOT BE DONE WITH MUSIC TO WIN SOULS THERE INTO HIGHER AND PURER AND BETTER LIVING
AFTER A WHILE ROLLIN WAS CALLED OUT AND RACHEL AND VIRGINIA BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER THINGS BY THE WAY WHAT HAS BECOME OF JASPER CHASE VIRGINIA ASKED THE QUESTION INNOCENTLY BUT RACHEL FLUSHED AND VIRGINIA ADDED WITH A SMILE
I TOLD HIM NO I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE THAT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST CONVERSIONS AT THE RECTANGLE I AM GLAD FOR YOU SAID VIRGINIA QUIETLY WHY ASKED RACHEL A LITTLE STARTLED
VIRGINIA CAME TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER TENDERLY WHEN RACHEL HAD LEFT THE HOUSE VIRGINIA SAT IN THE HALL THINKING OVER THE CONFIDENCE HER FRIEND HAD JUST SHOWN HER THERE WAS SOMETHING STILL TO BE TOLD VIRGINIA FELT SURE FROM RACHEL'S MANNER
ROLLIN WAS SILENT THEN HE WENT ON WITH MORE EMOTION I STILL LOVE HER VIRGINIA
DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
I AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO
BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
BUT AS HE WALKED PAST SALOON AFTER SALOON AND NOTED THE CROWDS GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THEM AS HE SAW THE WRETCHED DENS AS MANY AS EVER APPARENTLY
NO I'D BEEN RAISED TO BE EITHER MARRIED COMFORTABLY OR A WELL TO DO OLD MAID IF I CHOSE NOT TO MARRY THE POVERTY CAME ON SLOWLY BIBBS BUT AT LAST IT WAS ALL THERE
THIN YOUNG MAN WHOSE EXPRESSION WAS ONE OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HABITUAL WARINESS AND HABITUAL EAGERNESS HE PROPELLED A PERAMBULATOR CONTAINING THE THIRD
SHE GLANCED BACK AT BIBBS WHO HAD TURNED NORTH HE WALKS KIND OF SLOW AND STOOPED OVER LIKE SO MUCH MONEY IN HIS POCKETS IT MAKES HIM SAG I GUESS SAID THE YOUNG HUSBAND WITH BITTER ADMIRATION
WHAT IS THE MATTER I SAW SOMETHING WAS TERRIBLY WRONG WHEN I
BIBBS LOOK AT ME HER VOICE WAS LOUD AND CLEAR WHAT MADE YOU SAY THAT LOOK AT ME HE COULD NOT LOOK AT HER AND HE COULD NOT SPEAK WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOU SHE SAID I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
I KNEW YOU'D NEVER THOUGHT OF ME EXCEPT GENEROUSLY TO GIVE I SAID I COULDN'T MAKE IT PLAIN HE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY WAIT SHE LIFTED HER HEAD AND EXTENDED HER HANDS TO HIM UNCONSCIOUSLY LIKE A CHILD
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO TELL ME SHE SAID YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS THEY ARE TOO HUMILIATING FOR ME AND YOU'RE TOO GENTLE TO SAY THEM TELL ME THOUGH ISN'T IT TRUE
AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE A STENOGRAPHER I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE ANYTHING EXCEPT A WELL TO DO OLD MAID OR SOMEBODY'S WIFE AND I COULDN'T BE A WELL TO DO OLD MAID THEN BIBBS I DID WHAT I'D BEEN RAISED TO KNOW HOW TO DO
SHE MEANT NO HARM BUT SHE WAS HORRIBLE AND SHE PUT WHAT I WAS DOING INTO SUCH HORRIBLE WORDS AND THEY WERE THE TRUTH OH I SAW MYSELF SHE WAS PROPOSING A MISERABLE COMPACT WITH ME
AND I COULDN'T BREATHE THE AIR OF THE SAME ROOM WITH HER THOUGH I'D SO CHEAPENED MYSELF SHE HAD A RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT I WOULD BUT I COULDN'T I LEFT HER AND I WROTE TO YOUR BROTHER JUST A QUICK SCRAWL I TOLD HIM JUST WHAT I'D DONE
AS A GENERAL WAVE OF FEELING THAT WAS PASSING OVER THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THERE HAD COME A MOMENT QUITE SUDDENLY IT SEEMED WHEN IT OCCURRED TO EVERYBODY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY WAS ROTTEN THE WORD IS A STRONG ONE
IMAGINE IT AN IRISHMAN SITTING ON THE POLICE COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL IN A CITY WHERE THIRTY EIGHT AND A HALF OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED POLICEMEN WERE IRISH EITHER BY BIRTH OR PARENTAGE THE THING WAS MONSTROUS SO
YOU WANT TO LET THE BOYS KNOW TO KEEP PRETTY DARK AND GO EASY THERE'S A LOT OF TALK I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE ELECTIONS GOING ROUND THE TOWN LET THE BOYS KNOW THAT JUST FOR A WHILE THE DARKER THEY KEEP THE BETTER WHEREUPON THE WORD WAS PASSED
THE REST TO HIS SON AND IN THIS PERHAPS THERE WAS JUSTICE SINCE THE TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS BROUGHT TO MISTER CARLYLE BY HIS SECOND WIFE HAD BEEN CHIEFLY INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ACCUMULATION OF HIS LARGE FORTUNE MISS CARLYLE OR AS SHE WAS CALLED IN TOWN MISS CORNY
SUPPRESSING ALL SIGNS OF INCREDULITY I DON'T KNOW A FRIEND OF AFY'S HE SAID ARCHIBALD HE SWORE TO IT IN THE MOST SOLEMN MANNER AND I BELIEVE AS TRULY AS THAT I AM NOW REPEATING IT TO YOU THAT HE WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH
IT IS NOTHING THAT COULD INTEREST YOU A TRIFLING MATTER RELATING TO A LITTLE MONEY IT'S NOTHING INDEED THEN IF IT'S NOTHING WHY WERE YOU CLOSETED SO LONG WITH ARCHIBALD HE WAS ASKING THE PARTICULARS REPLIED BARBARA RECOVERING HER EQUANIMITY
TO HEAR YOUR OPINION ABOUT THE SCRAPE THE BENCH HAVE GOT INTO IS YOURS NOW IT'S NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER AND I TELL YOU ARCHIBALD I'LL HEAR WHAT IT IS I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU AND BARBARA DO WITH A SECRET BETWEEN YOU MISTER CARLYLE KNEW HER AND HER RESOLUTE EXPRESSION WELL
THEY HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A PLAY ACTED FOR THEM BEFORE OUT OF THE PEA SOUP BEFORE HE WAS QUITE DEAD QUITE SENSELESS OF ALL DROWNED RATS HE LOOKED THE WORST AS HE STOOD THERE WITH HIS WHITE RUEFUL FACE
HE WOULD HAVE BORNE ON WITHOUT LEGS AT ALL RATHER THAN REMAIN UNDER THE ENEMY'S GAZE THE ENEMY LOFTILY CONTINUED THEIR WAY THEIR HEADS IN THE AIR AND SCORNING FURTHER NOTICE ALL SAVE YOUNG LORD VANE HE HOVERED ROUND THE RANKS OF THE UNWASHED
FRANCIS LEVISON WOULD HAVE STOPPED IN THE POND OF HIS OWN ACCORD HEAD DOWNWARD RATHER THAN FACE THEM MISS CARLYLE WENT THAT DAY TO DINE AT EAST LYNNE
YOU'D HAVE GONE INTO LAUGHING CONVULSIONS LUCY HAD YOU SEEN THE DROWNED CUR I'D GIVE ALL MY TIN FOR SIX MONTHS TO COME TO HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM AS HE LOOKED THEN LUCY LAUGHED IN GLEE
I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU HOW WILLIAM SEEMS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE SHE MURMURED AND THEN SHE TOOK COURAGE AND SPOKE MORE OPENLY I UNDERSTOOD YOU TO SAY THE OTHER NIGHT SIR THAT HE SHOULD HAVE FURTHER ADVICE AY I WISH HIM TO GO OVER TO LYNNEBOROUGH TO DOCTOR MARTIN
I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
NOW LET ME BEHOLD THE CURIOUS PENS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR WORK LOOK
HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
AND WHICH SUDDEN CHANCE FREQUENTLY BRINGS ABOUT WHILE AFFECTING TO BE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN EXAMINING THE LADDER THE MIND OF DANTES WAS IN FACT BUSILY OCCUPIED BY THE IDEA
THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
FREDERICK WILL NOT BE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN A WIFE WITH LESS SENSE THAN HIS FAMILY EXPECTED I DO NOT ENVY HIS SITUATION EITHER AS A LOVER OR A SON MISS TILNEY
THANK GOD I AM UNDECEIVED IN TIME BUT IT IS A HEAVY BLOW AFTER MY FATHER'S CONSENT HAD BEEN SO KINDLY GIVEN BUT NO MORE OF THIS SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOREVER
TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
JERRY HAD SOME LETTERS TO WRITE SO SLIM WENT TO THE UPPER DECK ALONE
AND HIS MIND WEIGHTED ANYWAY WITH THE MENACING MYSTERY OF THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE HE SAT DOWN ON A COIL OF ROPE JUST IN THE LEE OF THE FORWARD SMOKESTACK TO THINK THE WHOLE MATTER OVER FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE WAS THUS ABSORBED WHEN SOMETHING AT FIRST VAGUE AND INDEFINITE THEN CLEARER
BROUGHT THE ENTIRE DOOR FROM ITS HINGES
THE UNCONSCIOUS FORM OF LIEUTENANT MACKINSON TUMBLED OUT UPON THE FLOOR HIS FACE WAS ALMOST BLUE FROM SUFFOCATION THE CAPTAIN SOUNDED THREE SHORT SHARP BLASTS UPON A WHISTLE WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM HIS POCKET AND TWO OILERS CAME RUNNING TO THE SPOT
HE MADE HIS WHEREABOUTS KNOWN BY TAPPING A MESSAGE ON A STEAM PIPE
IS SHOVED INTO A CLOSET AND ONLY ESCAPES DEATH FROM SUFFOCATION BY MAKING HIMSELF HEARD AS HE TELEGRAPHS FOR HELP OVER A STEAM PIPE IT MUST HAVE BEEN WHILE WE WERE RESCUING THE LIEUTENANT THAT THE SAME MAN AGAIN ENTERS THE WIRELESS ROOM AND LEAVES THERE THIS CHAIN
EVIDENTLY ALSO FROM THE BOILER OR ENGINE ROOM BRUSHED BY US HE HAD DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SAILOR SAID TO ME I THINK THAT WAS THE FELLOW THE ONE THAT JUST WENT BY NOT WANTING TO AROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS I ENDED THE CONVERSATION WITH A CASUAL REMARK AND THEN STROLLED AWAY UNTIL I WAS OUT OF THE SAILOR'S SIGHT
WELL SAID JOE I THINK I'VE GOT A PLAN THAT WILL WORK BUT
THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER WAS A MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OF A MAN BUT HIS VOICE BROKE OFF AS THE COMMOTION STARTED AGAIN CERTAINLY HE MUST HAVE A ROUGH CUSTOMER TO DEAL WITH THOUGHT JERRY
HIS THREE ASSISTANTS ON THE TRIP ACROSS WERE THE FIRST ONES NAMED THE OTHER TWO WERE TOM RAWLE A FELLOW PROPORTIONED LIKE THEIR FIRST FRIEND IN THE SERVICE SERGEANT MARTIN AND A WIRY ENERGETIC QUICK SPEAKING YOUTH NAMED FRANK HOSKINS
AND FROM THEM THEY HEARD MANY SERIOUS AND AMUSING STORIES MANY TRUE TALES OF THE ATTACK AND RETREAT OF SHOT AND SHELL AND SHRAPNEL AND THE HAND GRENADE AND THE POISONOUS GAS BOMBS THROWN BY THE BOCHES AND THEN ONE BY ONE THE SOLDIERS OF UNCLE SAM DROPPED OFF INTO LONG
WERE PURSUING THEIR UNEVEN COURSE TOWARD THE FRONT IN PREPARATION FOR A NEW KIND OF ASSAULT THEY LOOK LIKE MINIATURE BATTLESHIPS ON LAND DON'T THEY EXCLAIMED SLIM
EVERY DETAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BATTLE JERRY KNEW HIS OWN OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OVER THE SIDE INFORMED HIM OF THE TEMPORARY REVERSES HIS OWN ARMY WAS SUFFERING WHILE THE REMARKS OF THE OFFICER TOLD HIM WHERE THE GERMANS WERE MEETING THEIR BITTEREST REPULSES
THE WAVERING SWAYING TARGET WAS WATCHED FROM TIME TO TIME AND SPECULATIONS MADE AS TO HOW LONG IT COULD REMAIN WITHOUT BEING PUNCTURED BY A BULLET
MORE EASILY HANDLED AEROPLANES AND USED IN GREAT NUMBERS BY THE GERMANS SHOT INTO THE AIR AT GREAT SPEED FROM BEHIND THE BOCHE ENTRENCHMENTS
BUT AGAIN WASHINGTON KNEW THAT THE BRITISH AND FRENCH LOSSES AT THE SOMME HAD BEEN FRIGHTFUL THAT THE AMOUNT OF LOST TERRITORY REGAINED WAS NEGLIGIBLE AS AGAINST THE TERRITORY STILL HELD THAT THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS WAS ACUTE
NOT YET BUT OF COURSE I SHALL BE WHEN YOU REALLY GET GOING I WONDER IF YOU WILL TAKE ME ROUND AND SHOW ME HOW SHELLS ARE MADE I'M THE MOST IGNORANT PERSON YOU EVER KNEW I'LL BE AWFULLY GLAD TO
SHE WAS HOLDING OUT BOTH HANDS TO HIM PITEOUSLY YOU WOULDN'T GO WOULD YOU I MIGHT HAVE TO GO HE EVADED YOU WOULDN'T GRAHAM YOU'RE ALL I HAVE ALL I HAVE LEFT TO LIVE FOR YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO GO IT'S RIDICULOUS YOU'RE NEEDED HERE
TO STOP MY TONGUE AND FILL MY STOMACH BY THE TOKEN OF WHICH AS MY GAL SAYS SHE STUNTED THE GROWTH OF THE PRETTIEST FIGURE IN ALL MOWBRAY AND HERE THE YOUTH DREW HIMSELF UP AND THRUST HIS HANDS IN THE SIDE POCKETS OF HIS PEA JACKET WELL
BUT AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR I MUST HAVE LIFE THE MOMENT I CAME OUT I BATHED IN THE RIVER AND THEN WENT HOME AND DRESSED HE ADDED IN A SATISFIED TONE AND NOW I AM GOING TO THE TEMPLE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT JULIA HAS BEEN PRICKED TO DAY WITH A SHUTTLE
I PROPOSED TO GO WITH HER BUT TWO GIRLS ALONE YOU UNDERSTAND ME ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO BE SEEN IN THESE PLACES AS IF ONE KEPT NO COMPANY VERY TRUE SAID MICK AND NOW WE'LL BE OFF GOOD NIGHT WIDOW
MORLEY PAUSED AS HE RECOGNISED EGREMONT THEN ADVANCING TO GERARD FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION HE SAID THIS IS MISTER HATTON OF WHOM WE WERE SPEAKING LAST NIGHT AND WHO CLAIMS TO BE AN ANCIENT ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS
THAT APPEARANCE WAS PREPOSSESSING A FRANK AND EVEN BENEVOLENT EXPRESSION PLAYED UPON HIS INTELLIGENT AND HANDSOME COUNTENANCE HIS ONCE RICH BROWN HAIR STILL LONG THOUGH VERY THIN
IS YOURS THAT LIFE OF UNCOMPLAINING TOIL WHEREIN THERE IS SO MUCH OF BEAUTY AND OF GOODNESS THAT BY THE FINE MAXIM OF OUR CHURCH IT IS HELD TO INCLUDE THE FORCE AND EFFICACY OF PRAYER
MORLEY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN SAID AN EASY QUESTION QUESTIONS ARE ALWAYS EASY THE FACT IS IN ACTIVE LIFE ONE CANNOT AFFORD TO REFINE I COULD HAVE WISHED THE MOVEMENT TO HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT SHAPE
LAWFULLY MEETING IN OPEN DAY AND THEIR DELEGATES FROM THE WHOLE REALM DECLARING THEIR GRIEVANCES IN LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD NOT DISGRACE THE CONQUERING RACE WHICH HAS IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED TO DEGRADE THEM
WOMAN'S VANITY OFTEN OUTRUNS HER NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER GREAT BEAUTY STIFLES THE CONSCIENCE OF MODESTY VISITORS TO THE ACADEMY KNOW THE PICTURE CIRCE SEATED
WHILE UPON THE TESSELATED PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DAIS PURPLE GRAPES AND YELLOW ROSES HAVE BEEN STREWN THE BLACK HAIR OF THE DAUGHTER OF PERSEIS FALLS IN PROFUSION ABOUT HER BARE SHOULDERS AND STRAYS OVER HER BREAST
BUT HER FEATURES ARE HIDDEN BY A HALF MASK OF BLACK SILK THE LIPS WITH THEIR ARC DE CUPIDON ARE SLIGHTLY PARTED DISCLOSING AN EVEN ROW OF PEARLY TEETH
HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING OVER WHEN THE LIGHT HAD FADED TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND DISCUSS ART AND LITERATURE WITH ME I WAS GLAD OF A CHAT AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT MY WRITING TABLE BUT HIS COMPANIONSHIP HAD ONE DRAWBACK
YOU KNOW NOTHING OLD FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED FLUSHING ANGRILY BUT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
WHAT CHARACTER DO YOU THINK WOULD BEST SUIT ME WELL
AND SHE WAVED THE GOBLET SHE WAS HOLDING ABOVE HER HEAD YOUR POSE IS PERFECT DEAR PLEASE DON'T ALTER IT URGED THE ARTIST WHO ADVANCING TO HIS EASEL AGAIN CONTINUED THE FREE RAPID OUTLINE
AND SHE HAD HER FOOT UPON MY NECK BUT IT IS ALL OVER HE ADDED BITTERLY I SHALL THINK NO MORE OF HER THEN HE WISHED ME AN ABRUPT FAREWELL AND LEFT
ENABLED ME TO PAINT IN THE HALF LIGHTS UPON THE BLACK SILK AND THE LAUGHING EYES BEING FORTUNATELY INTACT I ALLOWED THEM TO PEER THROUGH THE APERTURES THE EFFECT PRODUCED WAS STARTLING
YOU SET YOUR FACE AGAINST ALL THE FAIR ONES BUT I SUCCEEDED IN TURNING THE CONVERSATION INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
I WILL BE TRUE TO HIM IF HE MARRIES ME HE SHALL NEVER HAVE CAUSE FOR REGRET NEVER SUPPOSE I TOLD HIM WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF YOU YOU WILL NOT SHE CRIED CLINGING TO ME YOU ARE TOO HONOURABLE FOR THAT
AND EXPLANATION AND WE LEFT THE COUNT WHO KNEELING BESIDE HIS WIFE AND ENDEAVOURING TO RESUSCITATE HER WAS COMPLETELY MYSTIFIED AT THE STRANGE RECOGNITION DICK ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH GRIEF
BUT BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL LIFE WAS EXTINCT THE COUNT IS INSANE WITH GRIEF MORE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE MAID DISCOVERED THAT HER LADYSHIP HAD LEFT A LETTER TO SOME MAN SHE CALLS DICK TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED HIM
ON THIS OCCASION AS ON PREVIOUS ONES I ASSISTED DICK TO RECEIVE HIS VISITORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY ETHEL HAD BEEN TAKEN SUDDENLY UNWELL AND COULD NOT ATTEND MY ANTICIPATIONS PROVED CORRECT
EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN EVIDENTLY RECOGNISING THE FEATURES THE PICTURE IS INDEED MAGNIFICENT
TO HEAR THE THUNDER OF THEIR FALL ECHOING AMONG THE HILLS BUT THE NEXT TIME HE VENTURED ABOVE GROUND WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND EVERYTHING CHANGED THE DARK WOODS WERE HEWN DOWN
BUT AT LENGTH CURIOSITY PREVAILED AND SHE AND HER COMPANIONS EXPLORED TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT
HE IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED TO CARE FOR HIM BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANOTHER IMAGE ALREADY FILLED HER HEART THE YOUNG PRINCE RATIBOR WHOSE LANDS JOINED HER FATHER'S HAD WON THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS
FOR THE ROOTS WHICH THEY HAD KEPT WARM THROUGH ALL THE CRUEL WINTER HAND NOW COME TO THEIR FULL SIZE DAY BY DAY THE PRINCESS PULLED UP SOME OF THEM AND MADE EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM CONJURING UP NOW THIS LONGED FOR PERSON AND NOW THAT
THEN AND THERE AFTER THAT BY THE POWER OF THE WONDERFUL WAND SHE SUMMONED A CRICKET AND TAUGHT HIM THIS GREETING HOP LITTLE CRICKET TO RATIBOR AND CHIRP IN HIS EAR THAT I LOVE HIM ONLY
WRAPPED IN A WONDERFUL ROBE OF SATIN FASTENED WITH A SILKEN GIRDLE WHILE BESIDE HER KNELT A YOUNG MAN WHO WHISPERED THE SWEETEST SPEECHES IMAGINABLE IN HER EAR THE GNOME FOR HE IT WAS TOLD HER ALL ABOUT HIMSELF
THIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE WAS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT THE PRINCESS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HER OWN EYES AND WAS QUITE BESIDE HERSELF WITH THE JOY OF HAVING HER DEAR PLAYFELLOW WITH HER ONCE MORE HAND IN HAND THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE ENCHANTED GARDEN
AS HE CROSSED THE MOSSY LAWN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER BUT ALAS SHE WAS NO LONGER THERE HE SEARCHED EVERY THICKET AND PATH HE LOOKED BEHIND EVERY TREE AND GAZED INTO EVERY POND
AND THE FORSAKEN GNOME RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE DEALINGS WITH SUCH FALSE CREATURES
IN OTHER WORDS PRACTICALLY ALL THE FINE GOLD OF KEATS'S WORK WAS PRODUCED IN THE MONTHS IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR FANNY BRAWNE WAS CONSUMING HIM AS WITH FIRE HIS GREATEST POEMS WE CLEARLY OWE TO THAT HEIGHTENED SENSE OF BEAUTY
TO ACCUSE HUNT OF WISHING TO ALTER KNIGHT AT ARMS TO WRETCHED WIGHT SEEMS TO ME UNWARRANTABLE GUESSING SURELY A MUCH MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT KEATS
BUT AS A SERIOUS AND PERMANENT PERSONAL SATISFACTION TO REST UPON MY WHOLE RELIANCE WAS PLACED ON THIS AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FELICITATE MYSELF ON THE CERTAINTY OF A HAPPY LIFE WHICH I ENJOYED
I AWOKE TO A RENEWED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE WOFUL FACT I CARRIED IT WITH ME INTO ALL COMPANIES INTO ALL OCCUPATIONS HARDLY ANYTHING HAD POWER TO CAUSE ME EVEN A FEW MINUTES OBLIVION OF IT
OR WITH THE ACCUSTOMED FEELING MINUS ALL ITS CHARM AND I BECAME PERSUADED THAT MY LOVE OF MANKIND AND OF EXCELLENCE FOR ITS OWN SAKE HAD WORN ITSELF OUT
I SOUGHT NO COMFORT BY SPEAKING TO OTHERS OF WHAT I FELT IF I HAD LOVED ANYONE SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE CONFIDING MY GRIEFS A NECESSITY I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE CONDITION I WAS
WERE IT NOT THAT WE OWE TO ANALYSIS OUR CLEAREST KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERMANENT SEQUENCES IN NATURE THE REAL CONNEXIONS BETWEEN THINGS NOT DEPENDENT ON OUR WILL AND FEELINGS NATURAL LAWS BY VIRTUE OF WHICH IN MANY CASES
AND THERE SEEMED NO POWER IN NATURE SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN THE FORMATION OF MY CHARACTER ANEW AND CREATE IN A MIND NOW IRRETRIEVABLY ANALYTIC
HIS APPEARANCE WAS WELCOMED BY A JOYFUL SHOUT FROM THE ATTENDANTS COME MY MASTERS HE CRIED FILLING THE HORN HERE IS A CUP OF STOUT WINDSOR ALE IN WHICH TO DRINK THE HEALTH OF OUR JOLLY MONARCH BLUFF KING HAL
TRAVERSED THE SPACE BEFORE THE WEST END OF SAINT GEORGE'S CHAPEL AND DESCENDING A SHORT FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AT THE LEFT AND THREADING A NARROW PASSAGE PRESENTLY ARRIVED AT THE ARCHED ENTRANCE IN THE CURFEW
THE DURABILITY OF FRAGILE THINGS DESTINY SOMETIMES PROFFERS US A GLASS OF MADNESS TO DRINK A HAND IS THRUST OUT OF THE MIST AND SUDDENLY HANDS US THE MYSTERIOUS CUP IN WHICH IS CONTAINED THE LATENT INTOXICATION
AN EMOTION TOO ACUTE CONVEYS NO MEANING TO THE MIND THERE IS A LIMIT TO COMPREHENSION AS WELL AS TO HEARING THE WAPENTAKE AND THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM APPROACHED GWYNPLAINE AND TOOK HIM BY THE ARMS
THAT CHILD WAS BROUGHT UP AND TRAINED TO BE A MOUNTEBANK AT MARKETS AND FAIRS HE WAS SOLD AT THE AGE OF TWO AFTER THE DEATH OF THE PEER HIS FATHER AND TEN POUNDS STERLING WERE GIVEN TO THE KING AS HIS PURCHASE MONEY
THE UNDERSIGNED BROUGHT UP AND KEPT FOR EIGHT YEARS FOR PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES THE LITTLE LORD BOUGHT BY US OF THE KING TO DAY FLYING FROM ENGLAND TO AVOID HARDQUANONNE'S ILL FORTUNE
THE DOCTOR APPROACHED AND DRAWING FROM THE POCKET OF HIS ROBE A LITTLE MIRROR OF STEEL PUT IT TO THE OPEN MOUTH OF HARDQUANONNE THEN WITH HIS FINGERS HE OPENED THE EYELIDS THEY DID NOT CLOSE AGAIN
AND WITH AUTHORITY FROM THE LORD CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND
IT IS TIME TO AWAKE YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF TO BE GWYNPLAINE YOU ARE CLANCHARLIE YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF TO BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU BELONG TO THE PEERAGE
IT WAS AN ANCIENT CARLOVINGIAN OFFICE THE AURICULARIUS OF THE OLD PALATINE DEEDS HE WHO WHISPERS TO THE EMPEROR WILLIAM BARON COWPER CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND
THROWING THE CAVE PART OF THE PIT INTO GREATER SHADOW THAN EVER I CANNOT ATTEMPT TO SAY HOW LONG WE HAD WAITED IN UTTER SILENCE WHEN QUARLES TOUCHED MY ARM SOMEONE WAS COMING AND WITH NO PARTICULAR STEALTH
I HEARD FOOTSTEPS ON THE RAISED FLOOR OF THE SHED A MAN'S STEP AND ONLY ONE MAN'S I HEARD HIM MOVING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME I THINK HE CAME DOWN THE LADDER ONCE AND WENT UP AGAIN
FROM OUR NEW POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AGAIN THE MAN'S FACE WAS FAMILIAR BUT JUST THEN I COULD NOT REMEMBER WHO HE WAS IT WAS THE BUNDLE HANGING OVER THE FIRE WHICH FASCINATED ME TIED TOGETHER AND SECURED IN A NETWORK OF STRING
WHY SHOULD A HEAD BE REQUIRED WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD BE LIKELY TO WANT A HEAD
SAID QUARLES LET'S GET ON THE ROOF I AM NOT SO YOUNG AS I WAS SO HELP ME UP IT WAS NOT MUCH HELP HE WANTED IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WERE ON THE ROOF AS I THOUGHT HE SAID
A PIT I CALL IT BUT IT WAS AS MUCH A CAVE AS A PIT PART OF IT RUNNING DEEPLY INTO THE EARTH AND ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF IT BEING OPEN TO THE SKY THE CAVE PART HAD A ROUGH SANDY FLOOR AND HERE WAS A LONG SHED OF PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED NEITHER SIR JOSEPH NOR LADY MAYNARD NOR ANY OF THE SERVANTS WERE DISTURBED DURING THE NIGHT BUT NEXT MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT BURGLARS HAD ENTERED THEY HAD GOT IN BY A PASSAGE WINDOW AT THE BACK
I THINK THAT WOULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE MAN'S TEMPERAMENT PROFESSOR
AND SO AS TO BE CONVENIENT TO HIS LINES HE WAS CAMPING ON HIS OWN WOOD LOT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN FISHING OR HUNTING ACCORDING TO THE SEASON AND PEDDLING THE PRODUCT IN NEIGHBORING TOWNS
WE WERE SOMEWHAT JADED BY THE TIME MONDAY MORNING CAME FOR SUNDAY BROUGHT NOT ONLY NO RELIEF BUT REPETITIONS OF MANY OF THE MOST HORRIBLE OF THESE TALES OF A WAYSIDE INN
WE WERE AT LYNDON AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THERE IS A POPULATION OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED CLUSTERED AROUND A RED PAPER MILL THE LATTER MADE A PRETTY PICTURE STANDING OUT ON THE BOLD BANK BACKED BY A NUMBER OF HUGE STACKS OF GOLDEN STRAW
A LONE FISHERMAN ENGAGED IN EXAMINING A TRAUT LINE STRETCHED BETWEEN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS GLOOMY ISLANDS AND THE MAINLAND KINDLY INFORMED US OF A MILE LONG CUT OFF THE MOUTH OF WHICH WAS NOW IN VIEW THAT WOULD SAVE US SEVERAL MILES OF ROWING
IT WAS A SCENE OF HOWLING DESOLATION RACK AND RUIN UPON EVERY HAND THE MUDDY TORRENT AT A VELOCITY OF FULLY EIGHT MILES AN HOUR WENT EDDYING AND WHIRLING AND DARTING AND ROARING AMONG THE GNARLED AND BLACKENED STUMPS THE PROSTRATE TREES
THE THUNDER STORM WHICH HAD BEEN THREATENING SINCE EARLY MORNING SOON BURST UPON US WITH A PRELIMINARY WIND BLAST FOLLOWED BY DRENCHING RAIN RUNNING ASHORE ON THE LEE BANK WE WRAPPED THE CANVAS AWNING AROUND THE BAGGAGE
SO WE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH ALACRITY AND PADDLED OVER THROUGH THE PELTING STORM OUR HOST WAS A YOUNG FISHERMAN WHO HELPED US AND OUR LUGGAGE UP THE SLIMY BANK TO HIS CANVAS QUARTERS WHICH WE FOUND TO BE DRY ALTHOUGH ODOROUS OF FISH
WAS LANDING A FARM WAGON AND TEAM AS WE PULLED IN UPON THE MUDDY ROADWAY WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT QUARTERS HE SMILED AND POINTING TO HIS LITTLE CABIN A FEW RODS OFF IN THE BUSHES SAID WE'VE FOUR PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN TWO ROOMS
THE BED CHAMBER INTO WHICH WE WERE SHOWN WAS A MARVEL IT OPENED OFF THE MAIN ROOM AND WAS DOUBTLESS ORIGINALLY A CUPBOARD SEVEN FEET SQUARE WITH A BROAD ROPED BEDSTEAD OCCUPYING THE ENTIRE LENGTH
AN EF I'D A SIGHTED WADE HAMPTIN THEN GOOD BY WADE I TOL THE CAP'N WHAT I WANTED BUT HE SAID AS HOW I WAS MORE USE A TAKIN KEER OF THE SUPPLIES THAT CAP'N HADN'T NO ENTERPRISE BOUT HIM
HE WAS MUDDLE HEADED ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A LARGE CIRCULATION AND A CIRCULATION SMALL BUT APPEALING TO THE RICH HE WOULD REFUSE ADVERTISEMENTS OF LUXURIES TO A PAPER READ BY HALF THE WEALTHIER CLASS IF HE HAD HEARD IN THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB
THIS CONNECTION HAS DEVELOPED IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CERTAIN CHARACTER WHICH CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED BY THE TERM OFFICIAL UNDER CERTAIN FORMS OF ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE MINISTERS ONCE MADE USE OF PICKED
NOW TO EVERY HUMAN EVIL OF A POLITICAL SORT THAT HAS APPEARED IN HISTORY TO EVERY EVIL THAT IS AFFECTING THE STATE AND PROCEEDING FROM THE WILL OF MAN NOT FROM UNGOVERNABLE NATURAL FORCES OUTSIDE MAN THERE COMES A TERM AND A REACTION
FROM THE SOCIALIST POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT THE INSINCERITY OF THE GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS IS THAT THIS INSINCERITY IS CAPITALIST JUST AS FROM A CATHOLIC POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT IT WAS AND IS THAT IT IS ANTI CATHOLIC
MEN FOUND THAT THE GREAT PAPERS IN THEIR FINAL PHASE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT IN RELIGION THEY DARED DO NOTHING BUT REPEAT VERY DISCREETLY THE VAGUEST ETHICAL PLATITUDES THEY HARDLY DARED DO EVEN THAT THEY TOOK FOR GRANTED A SORT OF INVERTEBRATE COMMON OPINION
TO PAPERS LIKE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH OR THE TIMES WITH THE EPITHET CAPITALIST PUT AFTER THEM IN BRACKETS I THOUGHT THEN IT WAS THE GIVING OF AN ABNORMAL EPITHET TO A NORMAL THING
YOU HAVE THE SINGLE TAX PAPERS YOU HAVE THE TEETOTAL PAPERS AND REALLY IT IS A WONDER THAT YOU HAVE NOT YET ALSO HAD THE ICONOCLASTS AND THE DIABOLISTS PRODUCING PAPERS THE RATIONALIST AND THE ATHEIST PROPAGANDA I RECKON AMONG THE RELIGIOUS
IF YOU ADD IT ALL UP AND CANCEL OUT ONE EXAGGERATED STATEMENT AGAINST ANOTHER DOES GIVE YOU A TRUE VIEW OF THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVE THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO DAY GIVES YOU AN ABSURDLY FALSE ONE EVERYWHERE
BECAUSE IT CAME LATER THAN THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CAPITALISM AND WAS IN ITS ORIGINS BUT A REACTION AGAINST IT B THE SECOND MOTIVE THAT OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD CAME TO WORK MUCH LATER THAN THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA
THEY HAD A GENERAL CONCEPTION THAT THE OWNER OF A WIDELY CIRCULATED POPULAR NEWSPAPER COULD AND DID BLACKMAIL THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN MAKE OR UNMAKE THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN BY GRANTING OR REFUSING HIM THE LIMELIGHT
THE LEADING LAWYERS THE RICH MERCHANTS THE SUCCESSFUL MANUFACTURERS NOT ONLY OPPOSED TO HIM BUT ENTERTAINING TOWARDS HIM SENTIMENTS OF PERSONAL DISLIKE AND EVEN VINDICTIVENESS THIS STRATUM OF THE COMMUNITY
BUT IN A MOMENT MISTER GLASCOCK OF GEORGIA MOVED THAT THE PETITION BE NOT RECEIVED DEBATE SPRANG UP ON A POINT OF ORDER AND TWO DAYS LATER BEFORE THE QUESTION OF RECEPTION WAS DETERMINED A RESOLUTION WAS OFFERED BY MISTER JARVIS OF MAINE
ONE THAT CONGRESS HAD NO POWER TO INTERFERE WITH SLAVERY IN ANY STATE TWO THAT CONGRESS OUGHT NOT TO INTERFERE WITH SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
THEY HAD ASSUMED AN UNTENABLE POSITION HENCEFORTH
FEBRUARY FOURTEENTH IN THE SAME YEAR WAS A FIELD DAY IN THE PETITION CAMPAIGN HE PRESENTED THEN NO LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PETITIONS ALL BUT THREE OR FOUR OF WHICH BORE MORE OR LESS
AND WAS ONLY ABOUT HIS DINNER HIS EYES OVER FLOWED BUT HE SHUT HIS LIPS SO TIGHT THAT HIS MOUTH GREW GRIM WITH DETERMINATION AND NO MORE TEARS CAME TO THE FRIEND WHO JOINED HER AT THE CHURCH DOOR AND IN GEORGE
WHO HAD DIED AT THE ALMSHOUSE AND WHOSE DYING MESSAGE TO MISTER CHILDS WAS THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR TO FILL A PAUPER'S GRAVE HIS WISH WAS CORDIALLY GRANTED BUT AFTER SEEING THE ADMIRABLE PROVISION MADE FOR HIS WORKMEN WE MUST ENTER THE PRIVATE OFFICE OF MISTER CHILDS
ALLIBONE DEDICATED HIS GREAT WORK DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH AND AMERICAN AUTHORS TO THE ENERGETIC AND APPRECIATIVE YOUNG PUBLISHER HE HAD NOW ACQUIRED WEALTH SOONER ALMOST THAN HE COULD HAVE HOPED BEFORE HIM WERE BRIGHT PROSPECTS
OF THE WORLD ONE COULD LINGER HERE FOR DAYS BUT WE MUST SEE THE LOVELY COUNTRY SEAT CALLED WOOTTON SOME DISTANCE OUT FROM THE CITY
AND TO PERCEIVE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RADIANT ROOF
I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE FIELDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL AT SUNSET I ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE
THAT I MIGHT VIEW THE ADJACENT COTTAGE
ALL THE LIGHT I ENJOYED CAME THROUGH THE STY
AND THEN SPREADING MY CLOAK I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SANK INTO SLEEP IT WAS MORNING WHEN I AWOKE AND MY FIRST CARE WAS TO VISIT THE FIRE
I OBSERVED THIS ALSO
IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEING SHOULD BE WRETCHED YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY
IT WAS POVERTY AND THEY SUFFERED THAT EVIL IN A VERY DISTRESSING DEGREE THEIR NOURISHMENT CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF THE VEGETABLES OF THEIR GARDEN AND THE MILK OF ONE COW WHICH GAVE VERY LITTLE DURING THE WINTER
AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
WHEN THEY HAD RETIRED TO REST IF THERE WAS ANY MOON OR THE NIGHT WAS STAR LIGHT
THAT HE INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF HIS SON'S SORROW FELIX REPLIED IN A CHEERFUL ACCENT AND THE OLD MAN WAS RECOMMENCING HIS MUSIC WHEN SOMEONE TAPPED AT THE DOOR IT WAS A LADY ON HORSEBACK ACCOMPANIED BY A COUNTRY MAN AS A GUIDE
AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADE SIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHE CAME SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND
THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND COLD PITILESS EXPRESSION
SOON RECOVERED ITS GLOSS IN THE PARTS WHICH WERE STILL PERFECT FOR THE WEARER TRIED HIS BEST TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW COAT HE BESTOWED THE SAME ATTENTION UPON THE CAMBRIC FRONT OF A SHIRT WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN COLOR
SAID THE SAME VOICE YOU SEE SOME ONE PAYS ME A VISIT AH MY DEAR SIR YOU WILL SEE WHETHER A CAVALCANTI IS TO BE TREATED LIKE A COMMON PERSON
ANDREA THREW HIMSELF UPON THE BED THE KEEPER RETIRED NOW SAID THE STEWARD WHAT HAVE YOU TO TELL ME AND YOU
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ENGAGED WITH A PYGMY LIKE YOURSELF
SEES THE MURDEROUS TRAP CLOSING OVER ITS HEAD A HOARSE BROKEN TONE
NO OH NO WELL MADAME IT WILL BE A LAUDABLE ACTION ON YOUR PART AND I WILL THANK YOU FOR IT YOU WILL THANK ME FOR WHAT FOR WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID
SHE VOCIFERATED NO YOU CANNOT WISH THAT WHAT I DO NOT WISH MADAME IS THAT YOU SHOULD PERISH ON THE SCAFFOLD DO YOU UNDERSTAND ASKED VILLEFORT OH MERCY
HE ADDED WITH A FLAMING GLANCE ANY OTHER WOMAN WERE IT THE QUEEN HERSELF I WOULD SEND TO THE EXECUTIONER BUT TO YOU I SHALL BE MERCIFUL TO YOU I WILL SAY HAVE YOU NOT MADAME
YOU HAVE DONE THIS I HOPE SO AT LEAST MADAME DE VILLEFORT STRETCHED OUT HER HANDS AND FELL ON HER KNEES I UNDERSTAND HE SAID YOU CONFESS BUT A CONFESSION MADE TO THE JUDGES
SUDDENLY THE DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO FADE AWAY FRANZ TOOK OUT HIS WATCH IT WAS HALF PAST FOUR THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL AT THE DOOR FRANZ ORDERED THE COACHMAN TO BE READY AT EIGHT HE WISHED TO SHOW ALBERT THE COLOSSEUM BY MOONLIGHT
HE PURCHASED POWDER AND BALL AND EVERYTHING SERVED HIM FOR A MARK THE TRUNK OF SOME OLD AND MOSS GROWN OLIVETREE THAT GREW ON THE SABINE MOUNTAINS THE FOX AS HE QUITTED HIS EARTH ON SOME MARAUDING EXCURSION THE EAGLE THAT SOARED ABOVE THEIR HEADS
THESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUND
AS HE HAD FOR THREE YEARS FAITHFULLY SERVED HIM AND AS HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE BY SHOOTING A DRAGOON WHO WAS ABOUT TO CUT HIM DOWN HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE PITY ON HIM HE TOOK CUCUMETTO ONE SIDE
THEIR PROMISES OF MUTUAL FIDELITY AND HOW EVERY NIGHT SINCE HE HAD BEEN NEAR THEY HAD MET IN SOME NEIGHBORING RUINS
AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE BAND DREW FORTH A TICKET THE TICKET BORE THE NAME OF DIOVOLACCIO HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD PROPOSED TO CARLINI THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHIEF
RETURNED THE CHIEF SHE IS THINE CARLINI RAISED HER IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF FIRELIGHT CUCUMETTO PLACED HIS SENTINELS FOR THE NIGHT AND THE BANDITS WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN THEIR CLOAKS AND LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
AS HE APPROACHED CARLINI RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE FORMS OF TWO PERSONS BECAME VISIBLE TO THE OLD MAN'S EYES A WOMAN LAY ON THE GROUND HER HEAD RESTING ON THE KNEES OF A MAN WHO WAS SEATED BY HER AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD
WHATEVER ELSE HE MAY BE HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN THE MERE BUSINESS OF INTERESTING US BEYOND ANY OTHER WRITER OF HIS TIME
DECLARE THAT BERNARD SHAW DOES DEPICT CHARACTERS
FOR INSTANCE WHAT MANY CRITICS HAVE FAILED TO SEE THAT IN HIS DRAMATIC WORK MISTER SHAW IS LESS A WIT THAN A HUMORIST IN SHAW'S WORK WE FIND FEW STUDIED JESTS FEW EPIGRAMS EVEN
IT MAY BE SAID OF MISTER SHAW THAT IN HIS POLITICS AS IN HIS PLAYS HE HAS SOUGHT UTOPIA ALONG THE PATH OF DISILLUSION AS OTHER MEN HAVE SOUGHT IT ALONG THE PATH OF IDEALISM
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS AN OLD WIDOW WOMAN WHO HAD THREE SONS THE FIRST TWO WERE CLEVER ENOUGH BUT THE THIRD BOBO BY NAME WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A SILLY SIMPLETON ALL HIS MOTHER'S SCOLDINGS AND BEATINGS
INSTEAD OF LAUGHING LITTLE TILDA WOULD FIND HIM A GLASS OF WARM MILK HANG HIS COAT BY THE FIRE TO DRY AND TELL HIM NOT TO BE SUCH A SIMPLETON AGAIN THUS AFTER A WHILE
SHALL WE SEND BOBO IN SEARCH OF THE LOST HALF HOUR SAID THE PRINCESS TO THE COURTIERS YES YES CRIED THE COURTIERS BOBO SHALL LOOK FOR THE LOST HALF HOUR I'LL GIVE HIM A HORSE SAID ONE
AND KEEP HIS CAVERN TIDY HE WOULD BURN OUR FIELDS WITH HIS FIERY BREATH YET WHO I ASK YOU WOULD BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR A DRAGON
THAT WE ARE MOURNING AT TWO O'CLOCK SHE IS TO BE CARRIED OFF BY THE DRAGON IT IS ALMOST TWO NOW ALAS ALAS HARDLY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF HER MOUTH WHEN THE TOWN BELL STRUCK TWICE SOLEMNLY AND SADLY
AND APPLIED TO THE PORTABLE ORGAN OF EARLY CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES AFTER THE TENTH CENTURY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MONOCHORD SEEMS TO HAVE BEGUN IN EARNEST TWO OR MORE STRINGS OF EQUAL LENGTH ARE NOW DIVIDED
EXECUTANT THE LESS EXQUISITELY REFINED ARTIST IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THESE TWO TYPES STAND TOGETHER ON THE THRESHOLD OF CLAVIER ART
THE FOUNDING OF WHOSE CHAIR OF MUSIC IS POPULARLY ATTRIBUTED TO ALFRED THE GREAT AS EARLY AS THE YEAR FOURTEEN HUNDRED CLAVIERS HAD APPEARED WHOSE STRINGS WERE PLUCKED BY QUILLS
CONTINUED COUPERIN'S WORK WHAT IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST PERIOD OF CLAVIER VIRTUOSITY BEGINS WITH THE NEAPOLITAN DOMENICO SCARLATTI
TOO OFTEN TREATED AS DRY AS DUST STUDIES ARE LADEN WITH BEAUTIFUL FIGURES AND DEVICES THAT FURNISH INSPIRATION FOR ALL TIME AS INDICATED BY THEIR TITLE WHICH SIGNIFIES A COMPOUND OF APPROPRIATE EXPRESSION
EACH WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK ONLY WHEN THERE WAS SOMETHING TO SAY BEARING ON THE SUBJECT IN HAND A HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC MOTIVE OR THEME AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE NOBLEST TYPICAL PHRASE
UNHAPPY PEOPLE HE LOVED AND WITH HIS OWN HOMESICKNESS WHEN AFAR FROM HIS CHERISHED NATIVE LAND PATRIOT AND TONE POET IN EVERY FIBRE OF HIS BEING
HE EVOLVED FROM ITS MORE INTIMATE DOMAIN EFFECTS IN SYMPATHY WITH THOSE OF THE ORCHESTRA YET PURELY INDIVIDUAL HE ENRICHED IT WITH NEW MELODIC HARMONIC AND RHYTHMIC DEVICES ADAPTED TO ITSELF ALONE
ALTHOUGH HIS MODE OF EXPRESSION WAS PECULIARLY HIS OWN HE HAD RECEIVED A STRONG IMPULSE FROM THE POPULAR MUSIC OF POLAND
AND WITHOUT CHANGE OF POSITION REQUIRED THE PRACTICE OF EXERCISES CALCULATED TO INSURE INDEPENDENCE THE PUPIL WAS INSTRUCTED TO GO THROUGH THESE EXERCISES FIRST STACCATO EFFECTED BY A FREE MOVEMENT OF THE WRIST
FOR THEY REPRESENTED TO HIM NATURE STRONG INDIVIDUALITY AND POETRY IN MUSIC AT ONE TIME HE UNDERTOOK TO WRITE A METHOD OR SCHOOL OF PIANO PLAYING BUT NEVER PROGRESSED BEYOND THE OPENING SENTENCES
IF IT IS PART OF THE SUM OF GOODS THAT FLOWS IN THAT IS NEWLY AVAILABLE FOR THE MAN'S USE IT IS INCOME BUT FUNDED INCOME IS THE MORE ABIDING FOR INCOME FROM WAGES STOPS
THE INCREASE OF RENTS IS DUE TO TWO CAUSES CHANGES IN THE AGENTS BY WHICH THEY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TECHNICALLY OR MORE NUMEROUS AND CHANGES TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE AGENTS
THAT MAKE MACHINES STRONGER QUICKER AND BETTER THIS PROPOSITION IS NOT LOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRECEDING A MACHINE IS AN ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL THINGS
THAT NO BIT OF MATERIAL WILL MAKE AN UNNECESSARY MOTION THE LOG ONCE STARTED THROUGH THE MILL IS CARRIED AUTOMATICALLY FROM ONE MACHINE TO ANOTHER UNTIL IT EMERGES AS A ROLL OF PAPER
ITS RENT RISES ALTHOUGH IT MAY CONTINUE TO TURN OUT THE SAME PRODUCT
IT IS THE STORY OF SARAMA IN THE RIG VEDA AND WAS WRITTEN IN SANSCRIT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HIMALAYAS CENTURIES BEFORE HOMER SUCH UNIFORMITY POINTS NOT TO A COMMON SOURCE IN HISTORY
SUPPOSIN IT'S MARRIED YOUR MAN IS WALLACE MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT ME BUT HE WOULD NOT MARRY WITHOUT TELLING ME IF HE IS ALIVE HE IS HONORABLE THEN I ASKED
WHEN THEY SEE ELK EVERY DAY IT IS A GREAT TEMPTATION TO TRY A SHOT ONE OF THE STUDENTS TOLD ME PROFESSOR GLENHOLDT WAS HERE TO GET THE TIP END BONE OF THE TAIL OF A BRONTOSAURUS
AS HE HAD HEARD THEY WERE FINE EATING HAVING STRATA OF FAT ALTERNATING WITH STRATA OF LEAN MISTER HAYNES IS A QUIET FELLOW JUST INTERESTED IN HUNTING MISTER STRUBLE IS THE BIG MAN OF THE PARTY
NOT TO MENTION CARRYING THE HEAVY GUN THEY ARE USING THE LARGEST CALIBER SPORTING GUNS MURDEROUS LOOKING THINGS THAT IS ALL EXCEPT MISTER HARKRUDDER THE PICTURE MAN
THE ELK WILL BE HERE LONG BEFORE THE MEN SINCE THE MEN HAVE NO HORSES SO LET'S HURRY AND GET PLACED ALONG THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GET OUT WE'LL GET OUR LIMIT WE HASTILY SECRETED OURSELVES ALONG THE NARROW GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELK MUST PASS
HIS NOSE HOWEVER SEEMS TO UPSET THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR IT IS LONG AND THIN AND BENT SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE HIS NECK IS LONG AND HIS ADAM'S APPLE SEEMS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHERE IT BELONGS AT SUPPER JERRINE WATCHED IT
THUS THE STEPS HELP TO MAKE THE POND A CONVENIENT RAIN GAUGE FOR OBVIOUSLY WHEN ONLY THREE STEPS ARE LEFT UNCOVERED AS WAS THE CASE LAST MONDAY
FOR WHEN YOUR WHOLE DAY'S CRICKET HAS BEEN SPOILT IT IS PERFECTLY ABSURD
FILLS YOU WITH THOUGHTS OF REVENGE FOR YOUR ACCIDENTAL DEFEAT THE EVENING BEFORE BUT INDOORS IT IS SO EASY TO DROP INTO A SOFA AFTER BREAKFAST AND ONCE THERE WITH ALL THE PAPERS
YET IF OUR HOSTESS WERE TO SEE US MARCHING OUT WITH AN UMBRELLA HOW ODD SHE WOULD THINK US WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SHE WOULD ASK AND WE COULD ONLY ANSWER LAMELY
I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PROMISED SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT A MAN WITH SUCH A BROAD AND FRIENDLY OUTLOOK TOWARDS RAIN GAUGES WILL BE SURE TO ARRANGE SOMETHING STRIKING WHEN THE GREAT MOMENT ARRIVES
I SAY THE SECOND BEST SO THAT IF YOU REMIND ME OF TOM JONES OR THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE OR ANY OTHER THAT YOU FANCY I CAN SAY THAT OF COURSE THAT ONE IS THE BEST
MY UNCLE BENJAMIN I READ IT IN THE TRANSLATION EAGER AS I AM TO BE LYRICAL ABOUT IT I SHALL REFRAIN I THINK THAT I AM PROBABLY SAFER WITH TILLIER THAN WITH BUTLER
SOME OF THEM HAD NEVER HEARD OF KENNETH GRAHAME WELL ONE DID NOT HAVE TO MEET THEM AGAIN AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS TO MAKE A WORLD BUT MOST OF THEM WERE IN YOUR POSITION
TO EVERY NEW GUEST AND IS REGARDED AS THE TOUCHSTONE OF HIS WORTH BUT IT IS A BOOK WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL THAT THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE LOVES IT IT IS ONLY YOU
AT THE BOOKSTALL I HAVE OFTEN LONGED TO BE A GROCER TO BE SURROUNDED BY SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS SARDINES BOTTLED RASPBERRIES
BISCUITS WITH SUGAR ON THE TOP PRESERVED GINGER HAMS BRAWN UNDER GLASS EVERYTHING IN FACT THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING
I SHALL HAVE TO TELL YOU THE MORNING POST NOW DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU THE WOMAN THE SHRIMPS ALONE NO THE PAPER ALONE NO BUT THE TWO TO GETHER
CONCEIVE THE HOLY JOY OF THE BOOKSTALL CLERK AS SHE AND HER BAG OF SHRIMPS YES HE COULD HAVE TOLD AT ONCE THEY WERE SHRIMPS APPROACHED AND ASKED FOR THE MORNING POST
BETWEEN THE PATRONS OF THE DANCING TIMES AND OF THE VOTE THE ERA AND THE ATHENAEUM DELIGHTFUL SURPRISES WOULD OVERWHELM HIM AT INTERVALS AS WHEN
RATHER OVERDOING THE PART AFTER WHICH HE WOULD HAND OVER THE WINNING POST AND THE ANIMALS FRIEND TO THE PURSUING DETECTIVE IN A SORT OF HOLY AWE WHAT A LIFE
BUT HE HAS OTHER THINGS THAN PAPERS TO SELL HE KNOWS WHO BUYS THOSE LITTLE SIXPENNY BOOKS OF FUNNY STORIES A PROBLEM WHICH HAS OFTEN PUZZLED US OTHERS
IT WAS A CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN THERE BY THE FUGITIVES IN THEIR HURRY TO GET AWAY THE SERGEANT MUCH AWED BY THE CITOYEN'S OBVIOUS RAGE AND IMPATIENCE PICKED THE PAPER UP AND HANDED IT RESPECTFULLY TO CHAUVELIN READ IT SERGEANT SAID THE LATTER CURTLY
MARGUERITE'S ACHING HEART STOOD STILL SHE FELT MORE THAN SHE HEARD THE MEN ON THE WATCH PREPARING FOR THE FIGHT HER SENSES TOLD HER THAT EACH WITH SWORD IN HAND WAS CROUCHING READY FOR THE SPRING
THE MOON HAD ONCE MORE EMERGED FROM BETWEEN THE CLOUDS THE DARKNESS ON THE CLIFFS HAD GONE GIVING PLACE ONCE MORE TO BRILLIANT SILVERY LIGHT SOME OF THE SOLDIERS HAD RUSHED TO THE ROUGH WOODEN DOOR OF THE HUT WHILST ONE OF THEM KEPT GUARD OVER MARGUERITE
YES SAID CHAUVELIN WITH EAGER IMPATIENCE SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO YOU SAID AND THE NEAREST CREEK IS A MILE FURTHER ON YES CITOYEN I RAN ALL THE WAY STRAIGHT TO THE BEACH THOUGH I GUESSED THE BOAT WOULD HAVE WAITED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CREEK AS THE TIDE WOULD REACH THERE EARLIEST
WITH A RAPID GLANCE CHAUVELIN NOTED ITS CONTENTS THE CAULDRON PLACED CLOSE UNDER AN APERTURE IN THE WALL AND CONTAINING THE LAST FEW DYING EMBERS OF BURNED CHARCOAL A COUPLE OF STOOLS OVERTURNED AS IF IN THE HASTE OF SUDDEN DEPARTURE
BUT THE LATTER HAD NOT WAITED AN INSTANT ONE PHRASE OF THE MOMENTOUS SCRAWL HAD CAUGHT HIS EAR
AT ANY RATE THERE IS A CHANCE TO GET HIM YET A THOUSAND FRANCS TO EACH MAN WHO GETS TO THAT CREEK BEFORE THAT LONG LEGGED ENGLISHMAN I KNOW OF A SHORT CUT ACROSS THE CLIFFS SAID THE SOLDIER AND WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC SHOUT HE RUSHED FORWARD FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY HIS COMRADES
HIS WELL LAID PLAN HAD FAILED ITS SEQUEL WAS PROBLEMATICAL THERE WAS STILL A GREAT CHANCE NOW THAT THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL MIGHT YET ESCAPE AND CHAUVELIN WITH THAT UNREASONING FURY WHICH SOMETIMES ASSAILS A STRONG NATURE WAS LONGING TO VENT HIS RAGE ON SOMEBODY
WHERE FALLEN INTO AN ABSOLUTE HEAP OF DEJECTION WITH HIS LEGS TIGHTLY PINIONED TOGETHER AND HIS MOUTH GAGGED LAY THE UNFORTUNATE DESCENDANT OF ISRAEL HIS FACE IN THE SILVERY LIGHT OF THE MOON LOOKED POSITIVELY GHASTLY WITH TERROR
THE JEW AND THE WOMAN CAN LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER HE ADDED ROUGHLY UNTIL WE CAN SEND SOMEBODY FOR THEM IN THE MORNING THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY VERY FAR IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND WE CANNOT BE TROUBLED WITH THEM JUST NOW CHAUVELIN HAD NOT GIVEN UP ALL HOPE HIS MEN HE KNEW WERE SPURRED ON BY THE HOPE OF THE REWARD
WHAT HAD BECOME OF PERCY WHAT OF ARMAND SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER SHE HEARD THE CHEERFUL SONG GOD SAVE THE KING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE SIGNAL OF DEATH I MYSELF CONCLUDED CHAUVELIN MUST NOW VERY RELUCTANTLY LEAVE YOU
AND IT HAS EVEN A NATURAL TENDENCY TO PERVERT THE TRUE BY INFUSING INTO IT A STRONG MIXTURE OF SUPERSTITION FOLLY AND DELUSION EACH GHOSTLY PRACTITIONER IN ORDER TO RENDER HIMSELF MORE PRECIOUS AND SACRED IN THE EYES OF HIS RETAINERS
BUT WE MAY OBSERVE THAT FEW ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN FIXED UPON A WORSE FOUNDATION THAN THAT OF THE CHURCH OF ROME OR HAVE BEEN ATTENDED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES MORE HURTFUL TO THE PEACE AND HAPPINESS OF MANKIND
ALL LIBERTY OF THOUGHT RAN A MANIFEST RISK OF BEING EXTINGUISHED AND VIOLENT PERSECUTIONS OR WHAT WAS WORSE A STUPID AND ABJECT CREDULITY TOOK PLACE EVERY WHERE TO INCREASE THESE EVILS THE CHURCH
MAY JUSTLY IN PART BE ASCRIBED TO THE LATE INVENTION OF PRINTING AND REVIVAL OF LEARNING NOT THAT REASON BORE ANY CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN OPENING MEN'S EYES WITH REGARD TO THE IMPOSTURES OF THE ROMISH CHURCH FOR OF ALL BRANCHES OF LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY HAD
WITH WHICH SUPERSTITION HAS EVERY WHERE OVERWHELMED THEM NOT TO MENTION THAT THE RAPID ADVANCE OF THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE AND THE VIOLENCE WITH WHICH IT WAS EMBRACED PROVE SUFFICIENTLY THAT IT OWED NOT ITS SUCCESS TO REASON AND REFLECTION
AND IN CONTRADICTION TO THE MULTIPLIED SUPERSTITIONS WITH WHICH THAT COMMUNION WAS LOADED THEY ADOPTED AN ENTHUSIASTIC STRAIN OF DEVOTION WHICH ADMITTED OF NO OBSERVANCES RITES OR CEREMONIES BUT PLACED ALL MERIT
THE AZURE FIELDS OF HEAVEN WERE SEMBLED RIGHT IN A LARGE ROUND SET WITH FLOW'RS OF LIGHT THE FLOWERS DE LUCE AND THE ROUND SPARKS OF DEW THAT HUNG UPON THEIR AZURE LEAVES DID SHOW LIKE TWINKLING STARS THAT SPARKLE IN THE EV'NING BLUE
HE SPOKE UPON THIS TOPIC WITH WARMTH REGARDING NOT SO MUCH ITS IMMEDIATE OR OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE WHICH IS LITTLE
FOR WHOSE SCRUTINY AND FOR WHOSE REFINED APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL MORE ESPECIALLY THAN FOR OUR OWN HAD BEEN SET IN ORDER BY GOD THE GREAT LANDSCAPE GARDEN OF THE WHOLE EARTH IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION
DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR WHICH HID FROM THE COMMON OBSERVER ARE REVEALED EVERYWHERE TO THE EXPERIENCED STUDENT OF NATURE THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING
AND IT WAS THIS BIAS PERHAPS WHICH IMPERCEPTIBLY LED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IF NOT THE SOLE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT
APPEALS DIRECTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CAN THUS BE FORESHADOWED IN RULE THE LOFTIER MERIT WHICH BREATHES AND FLAMES IN INVENTION OR CREATION CAN BE APPREHENDED SOLELY IN ITS RESULTS
SUCH AS THAT OF KEATS OR THE SENSITIVE PLANT OF SHELLEY BUT THE THING DONE
ARE LESS OBJECTIONABLE A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS JUST AND THE REFERENCE TO THE SENSE OF HUMAN INTEREST IS EQUALLY SO
BUT FOR THE INCONCEIVABLE WEALTH IN THE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF THE YOUNG HEIR THESE OBJECTS AND ALL ORDINARY OBJECTS WERE FELT TO BE INADEQUATE RECOURSE WAS HAD TO FIGURES
LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS TAKING OUT MY CUB TO PLAY IT WAS CARRIED OFF BY SOME BOYS AND ONLY SAVED BY YOUR GOODNESS THE DESIRE TO REQUITE THIS KINDNESS PIERCED ME TO THE QUICK AT LAST WHEN CALAMITY ATTACKED YOUR HOUSE
HALLO YOU BOYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT FOX THE ELDEST OF THE BOYS REPLIED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM HOME AND SELL HIM TO A YOUNG MAN IN OUR VILLAGE HE'LL BUY HIM AND THEN HE'LL BOIL HIM IN A POT AND EAT HIM
WELL REPLIED THE OTHER AFTER CONSIDERING THE MATTER ATTENTIVELY I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU WHOM YOU SELL HIM TO YOU'D BETTER LET ME HAVE HIM OH BUT THE YOUNG MAN FROM OUR VILLAGE PROMISED US A GOOD SUM IF WE COULD FIND A FOX
AS I TOLD YOU AT THE TIME THE OTHER DAY I TOLD MISTER SO AND SO THAT ALTHOUGH MY SON WERE TO DIE BEFORE MY EYES I WOULD NOT BE THE MEANS OF KILLING A FOX ON PURPOSE BUT ASKED HIM IN CASE HE HEARD OF ANY HUNTER KILLING A FOX
WHEN SHE HEARD THIS THE GOODWIFE LIKEWISE WAS BLINDED BY HER TEARS AND FOR A WHILE THEY LAY LOST IN THOUGHT BUT AT LAST COMING TO THEMSELVES THEY LIGHTED THE LAMP ON THE SHELF ON WHICH THE FAMILY IDOL STOOD
ARE LOCALLY WORSHIPPED TOUCHING THE REMEDY OF THE FOX'S LIVER PRESCRIBED IN THE TALE I MAY ADD THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STRANGE IN THIS TO A PERSON ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHINESE PHARMACOPOEIA WHICH THE JAPANESE LONG EXCLUSIVELY FOLLOWED
NIGHT AND MORNING HE RECITED THE PRAYER
BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
IT CAME AND SPENT THE WINTER NIGHTS WITH HIM FROM THIS STORY IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN BEASTS HAVE A SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN THIS QUALITY DOGS EXCEL ALL OTHER BEASTS
BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW IT BUT WENT TO FIND OTHER GAME SAYING TO HIMSELF WHEN I RETURN I SHALL FIND YOU AFTER THUS HE WENT FOR A LONG TIME UP AND DOWN THE HILL BUT FOUND NOTHING AND THEN RETURNED TO THE WATER MILL
BECAUSE HE HAD COME WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY NO SHEPHERD HAD BEEN ABLE TO COME FROM THE LAKE THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE GOT READY AGAIN AND WENT WITH HIS SHEEP STRAIGHT TO THE LAKE BUT THE EMPEROR SENT TWO GROOMS AFTER HIM TO GO STEALTHILY AND SEE WHAT HE DID
WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERS APPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM
BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
HOWEVER IT WAS HARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT
AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE
I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
SO THAT DAY PASSED ANOTHER AND YET A THIRD FOUND THE BOYS ENJOYING THEMSELVES TO THE LIMIT TEDDY WAS SHOWING DECIDED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT HE COULD GET AROUND FAIRLY WELL BY NOW JERRY HAVING CUT HIM A WALKING STICK WITH A CROOK AT THE END
AND NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THESE STRANGE HINTS PORTENDED WE HAD A SPECIMEN OF HIS NASTY TEMPER YOU KNOW CONTINUED BLUFF YES TWICE NOW WE'VE HEARD HIM TEAR AROUND LIKE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP
AT THE SAME TIME IT GAVE HIM FOOD FOR MUCH SERIOUS THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF TEDDY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT FIRE BUSINESS HE MENTIONED TO BLUFF A SHORT TIME LATER WHEN THEY WALKED TOGETHER DOWN TO THE SPOT WHERE THE MINK TRACKS HAD BEEN SEEN
OH NO IT ISN'T SO BAD AS THAT HE WAS ASSURED
THE BIG COWARD MUTTERED BLUFF CLENCHING HIS FISTS AND SHAKING HIS HEAD AS THOUGH HE WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO GET IN A BLOW AT THE BULLY MY OPINION AS FAR AS I HAVE ANY IS ABOUT LIKE THIS FRANK CONTINUED
JUST AS YOU SAY TEDDY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO PUT THE MATCH TO THE CAMP OVER AT LUMBER RUN WHEN NACKERSON HAD GONE AWAY PERHAPS WITH ONE OF HIS PALS WHO AGREED TO STAND BACK OF HIM THAT'S THE TIME TEDDY LIT OUT
AND TO THINK IT HAPPENED SO NEAR OUR CAMP THAT WE MANAGED TO TOTE THE WHOLE CARCASS TO THE CABIN AND BLUFF LOOKED WITH PRIDE IN HIS EYES TOWARD A DEER THAT WAS HANGING IN REAL SPORTSMAN STYLE FROM A LIMB HEAD DOWNWARD
IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH HE HAD MET WITH NOTHING BUT SUCCESS SO FAR FRANK ADMITTED I HOPE HE GETS THAT PRIZE THE RAILROADS ARE OFFERING SO FAR AS I CAN TELL HE HAS A DANDY COLLECTION ALREADY AND WE'VE GOT SOME TIME AHEAD OF US STILL BY THE WAY WHERE IS WILL NOW ASKED BLUFF
I THINK MYSELF IT WOULD BE A FINE WOODS PICTURE AND ADD TO HIS COLLECTION SPEAKING OF ANGELS AND YOU'RE MOST SURE TO HEAR THEIR WINGS CHUCKLED JERRY FOR THERE'S WILL COMING THIS WAY NOW AND ON THE RUN TOO ADDED FRANK
NO NEED OF THAT CAME THE REPLY BECAUSE I'D BE WILLING TO START AFTER THAT MOOSE ALONE AND FOLLOW HIM FOR A WEEK IF I THOUGHT I COULD GET A FAIR CRACK AT HIM IN THE END THEN IT'S A GO BLUFF
AND DON'T I HOPE THAT FIRST PICTURE TURNS OUT GOOD IT WAS A REMARKABLE POSE IF ONLY THE FOCUS WAS RIGHT HE STARTED TOWARD THE CABIN DOOR AS THOUGH ANXIOUS TO DEVELOP HIS ROLL OF FILM AND DISCOVER WHAT SUCCESS HIS LABOR HAD RESULTED IN
BLUFF CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARM WAIT JUST A MINUTE OR TWO WILL HE PLEADED TELL US SOME MORE WHERE DID ALL THIS HAPPEN FRANK KNOWS WHERE THAT SQUIRREL COLONY HAVE THEIR NEST IN THE TREE THAT'S GOT A HOLE IN THE TRUNK ABOUT THIRTY FEET UP THE OTHER REPLIED
THAT LIGHT SNOW FALLING LAST NIGHT WAS IN OUR FAVOR FOR THE TRACKS WILL SHOW UP WELL SUGGESTED JERRY HERE'S THE PLACE FRANK TOLD THEM A SHORT TIME AFTERWARD YOU CAN SEE THE TREE WITH THE HOLE IN IT OVER THERE
FOR UP TO NOW HE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN MUCH OF A CHANCE TO BRING DOWN ANY BIG GAME ON THIS TRIP AND WAS SECRETLY CHAFING
FRANK HOWEVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT A BLIZZARD MEANT UP THERE IN MAINE HE HAD BEEN IN ONE OR TWO HIMSELF AND WOULD NOT CARE TO REPEAT CERTAIN EXPERIENCES THAT HAD COME HIS WAY UNLESS WELL PROVIDED AGAINST HUNGER AND BITTER COLD
WELL SO LONG BOYS AND WE ALL WISH YOU SUCCESS
BIDDING THEM EMBRACE ISLAM THE PERSIAN REPLIED WITH THE THREAT THAT HE WOULD PUT THE PROPHET IN CHAINS WHEN HE HAD LEISURE THE ROMAN MADE NO DIRECT REPLY BUT SENT MAHOMET SOME SMALL PRESENTS
THE ROMAN FOUGHT WELL ENOUGH BUT HE DID NOT LIKE HIS ADVERSARY YEARN TO BECOME A MARTYR AND THE ODDS WERE ON THE MAN WHO HELD HIS LIFE THE CHEAPEST
THE EMPEROR LEARNT OF THE PLOT THROUGH HIS WIFE AND SAVED HIMSELF BY THE BOLD EXPEDIENT OF GOING AT ONCE TO ONE OF THE TWO KHAZAR CHIEFS AND ASKING FOR A SECRET INTERVIEW WHEN THEY WERE ALONE HE FELL ON HIM AND STRANGLED HIM
THEY RAISED HIM FUNDS BY FLAGRANT EXTORTION AND ILLEGAL STRETCHING OF THE LAW BOTH WERE VIOLENT AND CRUEL THEODOTUS IS SAID TO HAVE HUNG RECALCITRANT TAX PAYERS UP BY ROPES ABOVE SMOKY FIRES TILL THEY WERE NEARLY STIFLED
AND ENJOYED MUNICIPAL LIBERTY UNDER THE SUZERAINTY OF THE EMPIRE JUSTINIAN DISPLAYED IN HIS DAY OF ADVERSITY A DEGREE OF CAPACITY WHICH ASTONISHED HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE FLED FROM CHERSON AND TOOK REFUGE WITH THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS
SO JUSTINIAN RECOVERED HIS THRONE WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE HAD BY THIS TIME HALF FORGOTTEN HIS TYRANNY AND REGRETTED THE RULE OF THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS BUT THEY WERE SOON TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ERRED IN SUBMITTING TO THE EXILE
AND SHOULD HAVE RESISTED HIM AT ALL HAZARDS JUSTINIAN CAME BACK IN A RELENTLESS MOOD BENT ON NOTHING BUT REVENGING HIS MUTILATED NOSE AND HIS TEN YEARS OF EXILE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO SEND FOR THE TWO USURPERS WHO HAD SAT ON HIS THRONE
A SPECIAL EXPEDITION WAS SENT BY SEA TO SACK CHERSON THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR'S EXILE BECAUSE HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTED
WHO GAVE THE IMPERIAL CROWN TO THEODOSIUS OF ADRAMMYTIUM A RESPECTABLE BUT OBSCURE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES MORE MERCIFUL THAN ANY OF HIS EPHEMERAL PREDECESSORS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIS REPUTATION IN HISTORY UNHAPPILY FOR HIMSELF THOUGH HAPPILY ENOUGH FOR THE EAST ROMAN REALM HE SURVIVED YET TWENTY YEARS TO CARRY THROUGH A SERIES OF MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS EYES NOT LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE REPULSE OF THE MOSLEMS FROM HIS CAPITAL
BUT IN HIS TWENTY SECOND YEAR HE REBELLED AGAINST HIS MOTHER'S DICTATION AND TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE HELM OF THE STATE IRENE HAD ACTUALLY STRIVEN TO OPPOSE HIM BY ARMED FORCE BUT HE PARDONED HER AND AFTER SECLUDING HER FOR A SHORT TIME
THE ICONOCLASTIC CONTROVERSY HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR IT WHILE THE FACT THAT A WOMAN SAT ON THE IMPERIAL THRONE SERVED AS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE POPE'S ACTION LEO DECLARED THAT A FEMALE REIGN WAS AN ANOMALY AND AN ABOMINATION
THE SECOND A SMALLER SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT PAGES IN TWENTY SEVEN CHAPTERS WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN ILLUSTRATIONS TRAVERSES THE SAME GROUND AS THE LARGER WORK BUT BESIDES CONDENSATION MOST OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTATIONS AND NEARLY ALL THE REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES ARE OMITTED
THIS THIRD BOOK THE STORY OF ANCIENT IRISH CIVILISATION GIVES IN SIMPLE PLAIN LANGUAGE AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY IN THE OLDEN TIME BUT AS IT IS HERE TO SPEAK FOR ITSELF I NEED NOT DESCRIBE IT FURTHER
FROM WHAT PRECEDES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT COMBS WERE IN GENERAL USE WITH MEN AS WELL AS WITH WOMEN AND MANY SPECIMENS OF COMBS ARE NOW FOUND IN THE REMAINS OF ANCIENT DWELLINGS BATHING WAS VERY USUAL AT LEAST AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES
THESE WERE ALL GLADLY RECEIVED BY THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AND THE HAND OF FRIENDSHIP WARMLY EXTENDED TO THEM AND THE BEST OF COUNSEL AND ENCOURAGEMENT WAS OFFERED MATERIAL AID FOOD AND CLOTHING WERE ALSO FURNISHED AS THEY HAD NEED
AND IN MAKING AN EFFORT TO REACH CANADA HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO SUFFER MANY THINGS SO THE FIRST CHANCE CHARLES GOT HE STARTED AND PROVIDENCE SMILED UPON HIS RESOLUTION
CHAPTER THREE WAR BREAD BREAD IS THE STAFF OF LIFE FOR ALL NATIONS BUT BREAD DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THE WHEAT LOAF AT ONE TIME AND PLACE IT HAS BEEN BARLEY CAKE
OR IF THEY ARE PASTRY AND CRACKER BAKERS SEVENTY PER CENT THEY MUST MAKE NO BREAD WHOLLY OF WHEAT FLOUR SOME SUBSTITUTE MUST BE MIXED WITH THE WHEAT WHEN THE REGULATION WENT INTO EFFECT IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
WASTE OF ANY KIND IS VERY HEAVILY PUNISHED ONE WOMAN WAS FINED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THROWING AWAY STALE BREAD WHY NOT SEND CORN ABROAD
THE COST TO THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY ESTIMATED ALL THE WAY FROM TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FIFTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED IN THEIR CONSUMPTION BY RATIONING
STUCK WITH A GALLANT AND FIERY AIR OVER HIS LEFT EYE SUCH WAS THE CHIVALRIC PORT OF PETER THE HEADSTRONG AND WHEN HE MADE A SUDDEN HALT PLANTED HIMSELF FIRMLY ON HIS SOLID SUPPORTER
WHENEVER ANY ONE ASKED HIM HOW DO YOU INTEND TO DRESS YOURSELF THIS EVENING HE REPLIED I SHALL UNDRESS MYSELF AT WHICH THE LADIES ALL LAUGHED
SEEMED AS IF HE HAD CEASED TO BE A SOLDIER AS IF HE WERE NO LONGER AN OFFICER BELONGING TO THE PALACE BUT WAS ON THE CONTRARY A QUIET EASY GOING CITIZEN IN A STATE OF STAGNATION BETWEEN HIS DINNER AND SUPPER OR BETWEEN HIS SUPPER AND HIS BED
HE LOOKED LIKE A BASKET MAKER MAKING BASKETS YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT PLANCHET HE DID
IN POINT OF FACT THEN BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP IS PLAIN ENOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE MAY BE FATIGUED AND PLANCHET SMILED IN A ROGUISH WAY AS FOR BETTER TO BE LYING DOWN LET THAT PASS
EXACTLY WELL THEN I AM LIKE HIS HARE HE HAS GOT A HARE ALSO THEN HE HAS ALL SORTS OF ANIMALS WELL WHAT DOES HIS HARE DO THEN
THINKS AH
HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO DISAPPEAR
HE WILL VERY SOON HAVE NONE AT ALL TO DO IF THIS SORT OF THING CONTINUES GRUMBLED THE FOREMAN WHO HAD PLANCHET'S WORD THAT HE SHOULD BE HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE MIDST OF HIS DESPAIR
HOW SO WHY YOU SEEM TO BE IN THE WAY OF MAKING YOUR FORTUNE VERY SOON
IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CAN WALK ABOUT THE KING'S FOREST WHICH IS VERY BEAUTIFUL
MONSIEUR LE BARON DU VALLON
HAWTHORN AND WILD HOPS FORMED AN IMPENETRABLE FENCE BEHIND WHICH ROSE A WHITE HOUSE WITH A HIGH TILED ROOF
ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE TOOK HOLD OF HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND LED IT ABOUT THIRTY PACES FURTHER ON HIS TWO COMPANIONS FOLLOWING HIM HE THEN ADVANCED ABOUT ANOTHER THIRTY PACES UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF A CART HOUSE LIGHTED BY AN IRON GRATING AND LIFTING UP A WOODEN LATCH PUSHED OPEN ONE OF THE FOLDING DOORS
AT THE SOUND OF THIS GIGANTIC VOICE THE CAT TOOK FLIGHT
PORTHOS BOWED WITH A REVERENCE WHICH ANNE OF AUSTRIA WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF
I HAVE HAD FOUR AVENUES LAID OUT AND AT THE END OF EACH IS A LANDSCAPE OF AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT CHARACTER FROM THE OTHERS
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REPRESENTATION NOW FOR I THINK I HEARD SOMETHING LIKE CHANTING YES SAID D'ARTAGNAN I HEAR SINGING TOO
IT IS ARAMIS HIMSELF ARAMIS IN FACT REMAINED ALONE ON THAT SIDE AT LEAST FOR HARDLY HAD HE TURNED HIS HEAD WHEN A WOMAN'S FOOTSTEPS AND THE RUSTLING OF HER DRESS WERE HEARD IN THE PATH CLOSE TO HIM HE IMMEDIATELY TURNED ROUND
AND IS A WOMAN OF HIGH RANK IN SOCIETY I OUGHT TO KNOW THAT FIGURE AND PECULIAR STYLE OF WALK AS HE RAN THE SOUND OF HIS SPURS AND OF HIS BOOTS UPON THE HARD GROUND OF THE STREET MADE A STRANGE JINGLING NOISE A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITSELF
SOME TEN FEET IN LENGTH ENDING IN A SIMPLE SWITCHBOARD PLUG WHICH MERCER FITTED INTO THE UPPERMOST OF THE THREE JACKS NOW HE DIRECTED YOU PUT ON THIS ONE
THE WORDS WERE NOT SPOKEN I DID NOT HEAR THEM I KNEW THEM WHAT I GLANCED AT MERCER AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD WITH PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT IT WORKED HE CRIED
THEN WITH ALL THREE OF THE DEVICES HE CALLED ANTENNAE IN HIS HAND THEIR LEADS PLUGGED INTO THE CONTROL PANEL HE LED THE WAY TO THE SIDE OF THE POOL
SHE CAME CLOSER WALKING WITH THE AIRY GRACE I HAD NOTED BEFORE AND MY HEART POUNDED AGAINST MY RIBS AS SHE RAISED ONE LONG SLIM ARM TOWARDS ME
AROUND MANY OF THEM GREW CLUSTERS OF STRANGE AND COLORFUL SEAWEEDS THAT WAVED THEIR BANNERS GENTLY AS THOUGH SOME IMPERCEPTIBLE CURRENT DALLIED WITH THEM IN PASSING HERE AND THERE FIGURES MOVED SLIM WHITE FIGURES THAT STROLLED ALONG THE NARROW STREET
THE GIRL WAS THINKING OF HER SUFFERING TAKEN OUT OF HER NATIVE ELEMENT
THERE WAS A STRANGE FASCINATION ABOUT THIS GIRL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA A SUBTLE APPEAL THAT WAS ANSWERED FROM SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN OF MY BEING I FORGOT FOR THE MOMENT WHO AND WHAT I WAS
I WALKED ALONG BRISKLY FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
THE SHORE WAS LITTERED WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOTSAM AND JETSAM WASHED UP BY THE BIG STORM AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A MAN WITH A TRUCK COME AND CLEAN UP THE SHORE IN FRONT OF THE PLACE WHEN IN A LITTLE SANDY POOL I SAW HER
I RAN THROUGH THE FRENCH WINDOWS OUT INTO THE PATIO FOR A MOMENT SHE RAN AFTER ME RATHER AWKWARDLY AND HEAVILY BUT SWIFTLY NEVERTHELESS THEN SHE SAW THE POOL APPARENTLY FORGETTING THAT I EXISTED SHE LEAPED INTO THE WATER
MERCER SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK I DON'T GET IT MERCER SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT MADE NO OTHER REPLY UNTIL WE STOOD AGAIN ON THE EDGE OF THE POOL THE GIRL WAS STANDING WHERE WE HAD LEFT HER AND AS SHE LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE SHE SMILED AGAIN
NO MEAN FEAT UNDER WATER SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HER EYES FIXED ON MINE
MERCER DURING ALL THE YEARS I HAD KNOWN HIM HAD NEVER BEEN MOVED BEFORE TO SUCH TEMPESTUOUS OUTBURSTS OF ENTHUSIASM IT WAS HIS HABIT TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY IN HIS LOW MUSICAL VOICE EVEN IN THE MIDST OF OUR HOTTEST ARGUMENTS AND WE HAD HAD MANY OF THEM
EVEN IN THE SOFT LIGHT I COULD SEE HER PERFECTLY THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER HER PALE BODY OUTLINED SHARPLY AGAINST THE JADE GREEN TILES I TORE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE STARING CURIOUS EYES OF THE FIGURE IN GOD'S NAME MERCER WHAT IS IT
I TRIED TO LOOK AWAY AND FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO MOVE I FELT MERCER'S TENSE SUDDEN GRIP UPON MY ARM BUT I DID NOT COULD NOT LOOK AT HIM SHE SHE'S SMILING I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM
AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
AND THE NECESSARY WARS IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COMMONS IN THIS PARTICULAR NOR COULD THE AUTHORITY OF THAT PRINCESS WHICH WAS OTHERWISE ALMOST ABSOLUTE EVER EXTORT FROM THEM THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES
WOULD NOT AUGMENT THEIR NUMBER IN THE SAME PROPORTION THE PURITANICAL PARTY THOUGH DISGUISED HAD A GREAT AUTHORITY OVER THE KINGDOM AND MANY OF THE LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS HAD SECRETLY EMBRACED THE RIGID TENETS OF THAT SECT
IN ORDER TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST THE RESENTMENT OF JAMES BUCKINGHAM HAD AFFECTED POPULARITY AND ENTERED INTO THE CABALS OF THE PURITANS BUT BEING SECURE OF THE CONFIDENCE OF CHARLES HE HAD SINCE ABANDONED THIS PARTY
THOUGH IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT CROWN WERE MUCH LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE PROTESTANTS AND LESS AGREEABLE TO THE CATHOLICS THAN THE ALLIANCE FORMERLY PROJECTED WITH SPAIN AND WERE THEREFORE RECEIVED RATHER WITH PLEASURE THAN DISSATISFACTION
IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIX A CHOICE EITHER TO ABANDON ENTIRELY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE OR TO SECURE THEM BY FIRMER AND MORE PRECISE BARRIERS THAN THE CONSTITUTION HAD HITHERTO PROVIDED FOR THEM IN THIS DILEMMA
THE EXTREME RAGE AGAINST POPERY WAS A SURE CHARACTERISTIC OF PURITANISM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DISCOVERED OTHER INFALLIBLE SYMPTOMS OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT PARTY
THE KING FINDING THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS RESOLVED TO GRANT HIM NO SUPPLY AND WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROTESTATIONS OF DUTY
HE SUBMITTED TO THE KING'S COMMANDS OF REMAINING AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT AND OF ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT MANY TRIALS HE MADE TO REGAIN THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS MASTER
THE KING'S PROHIBITION WAS WITHDRAWN AND BRISTOL TOOK HIS SEAT PROVOKED AT THESE REPEATED INSTANCES OF VIGOR WHICH THE COURT DENOMINATED CONTUMACY CHARLES ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ENTER AN ACCUSATION OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST HIM
THE ONLY CHARGE WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE HAD EXTORTED A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THAT HE HAD CONFISCATED SOME GOODS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS ON PRETENCE OF THEIR BEING THE PROPERTY OF SPANISH
HIS MOTHER WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS A PROFESSED CATHOLIC HIS WIFE WAS NOT FREE FROM SUSPICION
TO MORROW THEY WILL ATTACK SOME BRANCH OF HIS PREROGATIVE BY THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS THEY HAD ENGAGED THE CROWN IN A WAR AS SOON AS THEY SAW A RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE
THAT FORTS WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO BRIDLE ROCHELLE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BULWARK OF THE PROTESTANTS THAT THE REFORMED IN FRANCE CAST THEIR EYES ON CHARLES AS THE HEAD OF THEIR FAITH
IN RELIGION AND POLITICS HE YET ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE GAINED BY THESE ARGUMENTS ENFORCED BY THE SOLICITATIONS OF BUCKINGHAM A FLEET OF A HUNDRED SAIL AND AN ARMY OF SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WERE FITTED OUT FOR THE INVASION OF FRANCE
AND BOTH OF THEM INTRUSTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE WHO WAS ALTOGETHER UNACQUAINTED BOTH WITH LAND AND SEA SERVICE THE FLEET APPEARED BEFORE ROCHELLE BUT SO ILL CONCERTED WERE BUCKINGHAM'S MEASURES THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT CITY
EACH A WAD OF FINE DRY GRASS AS LARGE AS A QUART BOX THESE WERE GATHERED UP AND FILLED THE GREAT BASKET THERE SAID HE TRIUMPHANTLY DON'T THEM SMELL MOUSEY THEY DID CERTAINLY
HOW OR BY WHAT WILES THAT FOX GOT THE TURKEYS OUT OF THE HIGH BUTTERNUT IS A SECRET
CANTON DID HIM HONOR I WITNESSED THE LEAVE TAKING AT HIS HOUSE HIS RIDE TO THE TRAIN IN THE COACH DRAWN BY FOUR GREYS UNDER ESCORT OF A BAND
CHOCOLATE BEAN CASTOR OIL BEAN PORK BEAN AND ALL KINDS I FIRST ATE THE CAKE OF CHOCOLATE THEN SOME SUGAR AND DRANK TWO DIPPERSFUL OF HOT WATER THEN SHOOK MYSELF
MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR FREQUENTLY SINCE CROSSING THE MISSISSIPPI POD HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM PROUD PARENTS INFORMING HIM THAT THEY HAD NAMED THEIR LATEST BOY AFTER HIM
COONSKIN'S OPINION DIDN'T BENEFIT POD MUCH HIS HARD WOOD FIRE WASN'T VERY SATISFACTORY BUT WITH SOME DRY BRUSH THE MEN GOT THE MEAL UNDER WAY NEXT MORNING WE VISITED THE NOTED PETRIFIED STUMP
THAT'S THE THIEF THERE NEXT MORNING COONSKIN WAS THE FIRST TO RETURN FROM FISHING AND LOOKED MUCH EXCITED WHEN POD RETURNED HE TOLD HIM HE HAD SEEN HUGE BEAR TRACKS HE WAS GOING BEAR HUNTING POD LAUGHED AT HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD BE WORTH A HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE TO SEE ONE WILD I'VE ONLY SEEN BEARS IN CIRCUSES OR TRAVELING CHAINED TO ITALIANS IN THE SECOND PLACE I CAN RUN I'VE PLENTY OF MEDALS FOR SPRINTING
THEREFORE LET'S CONCENTRATE ON OUR CHANCES OF BEING CRUSHED OR ASPHYXIATED AS FOR ASPHYXIATION CAPTAIN I REPLIED THAT ISN'T A CAUSE FOR ALARM BECAUSE THE AIR TANKS ARE FULL TRUE
MY FRIENDS I SAID WE'RE IN A SERIOUS PREDICAMENT BUT I'M COUNTING ON YOUR COURAGE AND ENERGY SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED THIS IS NO TIME TO BORE YOU WITH MY COMPLAINTS
BEFORE DIGGING INTO THE ICE THE CAPTAIN HAD TO OBTAIN BORINGS TO INSURE WORKING IN THE BEST DIRECTION LONG BORES WERE DRIVEN INTO THE SIDE WALLS BUT AFTER FIFTEEN METERS THE INSTRUMENTS WERE STILL IMPEDED BY THE THICKNESS OF THOSE WALLS
THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE AREA ONLY TWO METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED ONLY TWO METERS SEPARATED US FROM THE OPEN SEA BUT THE SHIP'S AIR TANKS WERE NEARLY EMPTY THE LITTLE AIR THAT REMAINED HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN NOT AN
BROUGHT TO FULL SPEED THE PROPELLER MADE THE SHEET IRON HULL TREMBLE DOWN TO ITS RIVETS AND WE SPED NORTHWARD BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO NAVIGATE UNDER THE ICE BANK TO THE OPEN SEA ANOTHER DAY I WOULD BE DEAD FIRST
A FEW WHIFFS OF AIR HAD ENTERED MY LUNGS HAD WE RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES HAD WE CLEARED THE ICE BANK NO NED AND CONSEIL MY TWO GALLANT FRIENDS WERE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE ME
FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON HOW I GOT ONTO THE PLATFORM I'M UNABLE TO SAY PERHAPS THE CANADIAN TRANSFERRED ME THERE BUT I COULD BREATHE I COULD INHALE THE LIFE GIVING SEA AIR
CONSEIL PUT IN YES NED LAND WENT ON YOU CAN REPAY YOUR DEBT BY COMING WITH ME WHEN I LEAVE THIS INFERNAL NAUTILUS BY THE WAY CONSEIL SAID ARE WE GOING IN A FAVORABLE DIRECTION
WE'LL NEVER REGRET HAVING KNOWN HIM ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE LEFT HIM NED LAND SHOT BACK THE NEXT DAY
AS FOR FISH I SPECIFICALLY OBSERVED SOME BONY FISH BELONGING TO THE GOBY GENUS ESPECIALLY SOME GUDGEON TWO DECIMETERS LONG SPRINKLED WITH WHITISH AND YELLOW SPOTS
SOME OF THESE JELLYFISH WERE SHAPED LIKE VERY SMOOTH SEMISPHERIC PARASOLS WITH RUSSET STRIPES AND FRINGES OF TWELVE NEAT FESTOONS OTHERS LOOKED LIKE
BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE METERS AND WENT ALONG THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST
SHE NOTICED IT AND ASKED HIM THE REASON TO HIM KNOWING THAT EVERY JOY EVERY PLEASURE AND PAIN THAT SHE FELT SHE COMMUNICATED TO HIM AT ONCE TO HIM NOW TO SEE THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO NOTICE HIS STATE OF MIND
SHE HEARD AN EVEN TRANQUIL SNORE FOR THE FIRST INSTANT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SEEMED AS IT WERE APPALLED AT HIS OWN SNORING AND CEASED BUT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO BREATHINGS THE SNORE SOUNDED AGAIN
WHEN THE PRINCES UNDERSTOOD WHITHER THE ARGONAUTS WERE GOING THEY OFFERED TO TURN BACK AND GUIDE THEM TO COLCHIS
EVERY PERSON WHO MIGHT VENTURE WITHIN HIS REACH THERE ARE OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG PRINCES
HAD COME TO COLCHIS WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TAKING AWAY HIS CHIEF TREASURE
AND THE FOUR FOOTED PEDANT HIS SCHOOLMASTER INTO THE BARGAIN WHY WHAT A FOOLHARDY SELF CONCEITED COXCOMB HE IS WE'LL SEE WHAT MY FIRE BREATHING BULLS WILL DO FOR HIM WELL PRINCE JASON HE CONTINUED ALOUD AND AS COMPLAISANTLY AS HE COULD
WHICH WILL PREVENT YOU FROM BEING BURNED UP AND CURE YOU IF YOU CHANCE TO BE A LITTLE SCORCHED
THE INSTANT HE MADE A STEP FARTHER
FOR AN OFFENSE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD COMMITTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALMOST AS SHORT INDEED AS IT HAD TAKEN THEM TO GROW UP ALL BUT ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH WERE STRETCHED LIFELESS ON THE FIELD
NOT TO RUN ANY FURTHER RISK OF LOSING HIS BELOVED FLEECE YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS BUSINESS YOUNG MAN SAID HE IF MY UNDUTIFUL DAUGHTER MEDEA HAD NOT HELPED YOU WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS HAD YOU ACTED FAIRLY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THIS INSTANT
WE WERE UNITED ON NO OTHER SUBJECT SOME WOULD OFFER PASSIVE RESISTANCE TO THE WAR OTHERS WOULD BECOME DEVOTED FOLLOWERS OF A VIGOROUS MILITARY POLICY BETWEEN THESE EVERY SHADE OF OPINION WAS REPRESENTED EACH WAS LOYAL TO THE IDEAS WHICH SHE HELD FOR HER COUNTRY
THE MANIFESTATIONS OF POPULAR APPROVAL OF SUFFRAGE THE CONSTANT STREAM OF PROTESTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AGAINST ITS DELAY NATIONALLY AND THE SHAME OF HAVING WOMEN BEGGING AT ITS GATES COULD RESULT IN ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS
SUCH WAS OUR DEMOCRATIC ZEAL TO PERSUADE RUSSIA TO CONTINUE THE WAR AND TO CONVINCE HER PEOPLE OF ITS DEMOCRATIC PURPOSES AND OF THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITY OF AMERICA
WE INTENDED TO KNOW WHY IF DEMOCRACY WERE SO PRECIOUS AS TO DEMAND THE NATION'S BLOOD AND TREASURE FOR ITS ACHIEVEMENT ABROAD ITS EXECUTION AT HOME WAS SO UNDESIRABLE MEANWHILE
AND INSTRUCTING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CONVENTION TO REQUEST A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL LIBERAL GROUPS
GOVERNMENTS DERIVE THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE THIRTEEN SILENT SENTINELS WITH BANNERS BEARING THE SAME WORDS ARE ARRESTED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY DROLL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO TRAGIC
THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN CONCLUDES WITH IT IS A FACT THAT THERE REMAINS IN AMERICA ONE MAN WHO HAS KNOWN EXACTLY THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TO TAKE AND MAINTAIN TOWARD THE PICKETS
AND AS ANOTHER MONTH OF PICKETING DREW TO AN END THE ADMINISTRATION VENTURED TO TRY OTHER WAYS TO STOP IT AND WITH IT THE CONSEQUENT EMBARRASSMENT THEIR METHODS BECAME PHYSICALLY MORE BRUTAL AND POLITICALLY MORE STUPID THEIR CONDUCT
TWENTY MILLION AMERICAN WOMEN ARE NOT SELF GOVERNED TAKE THE BEAM OUT OF YOUR OWN EYE WE DID NOT EXPECT PUBLIC SYMPATHY AT THIS POINT WE KNEW THAT NOT EVEN THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD OCCASIONALLY IN DEBATE BUT MORE FREQUENTLY IN THEIR CLOAK ROOMS
WHICH IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT GRATIFIED ME TO GET HIS INDIGNANT HEAD RELIEVED AGAINST A GREY LINE OF CLIPPED POPLARS AND THOSE SOLEMN PLAINS OF GAUL OVER WHICH BROODS THE MIGHTY SPIRIT OF MILLET
WAS A TALL ANGULAR YOUNG MAN WITH DARK HAIR STICKING UP LIKE A HAIR BRUSH INTELLIGENT AND EVEN DISTINGUISHED LINEAMENTS BUT A SALLOW AND ALMOST ALIEN COMPLEXION
IT WAS JUST AS IF A CRYSTAL FOUNTAIN HAD SPURTED IN THEIR EYES IN A NEST OF ORANGE VELVET LAY LIKE THREE EGGS THREE WHITE AND VIVID DIAMONDS THAT SEEMED TO SET THE VERY AIR ON FIRE ALL ROUND THEM
BUT EVEN THE ROUGH MEN ABOUT IN THE STREETS AND HOTELS COULD HARDLY HAVE KEPT THEIR HANDS OFF THEM I MIGHT HAVE LOST THEM ON THE ROAD HERE IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE QUITE NATURAL I SHOULD SAY
I'M SICK AT BEING SUCH A NUISANCE COLONEL HE SAID WITH THE CHEERY COLONIAL CONVENTIONS BUT WOULD IT UPSET YOU IF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE CALLED ON ME HERE TONIGHT ON BUSINESS IN POINT OF FACT IT'S FLORIAN
I LIKE THE JOLLY OLD PANTOMIME WHERE A MAN SITS ON HIS TOP HAT NOT ON MINE PLEASE SAID SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER WITH DIGNITY WELL WELL OBSERVED CROOK AIRILY
LED FISCHER TO SAY IN HIS MOST SARCASTIC MAGISTERIAL MANNER NO DOUBT YOU HAVE FOUND SOMETHING MUCH LOWER THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT WHAT IS IT PRAY
AND STOOD THROBBING HULLO HULLO SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE RED TIE HERE'S SOMEBODY BORN ON THE RIGHT SIDE ANYHOW I DIDN'T KNOW MISS ADAMS THAT YOUR SANTA CLAUS WAS SO MODERN AS THIS
WHICH WAS RATHER A LONG PROCESS A LARGE NEAT CHAUFFEUR IN GREEN GOT OUT FROM THE FRONT AND A SMALL NEAT MANSERVANT IN GREY GOT OUT FROM THE BACK AND BETWEEN THEM THEY DEPOSITED SIR LEOPOLD ON THE DOORSTEP
WERE UNDULY LARGE IN PROPORTION TO THE HOUSE AND FORMED AS IT WERE A BIG ROOM WITH THE FRONT DOOR AT ONE END AND THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AT THE OTHER IN FRONT OF THE LARGE HALL FIRE
AND NOW SAID CORONEL WE'D BETTER DECIDE WHAT TO DO BUT I DON'T MIND WHAT WE DO NOW SAID HYACINTH HAPPILY SHE MAY HAVE THE THRONE AND FATHER AND UDO AND
IT WILL ANNOY YOUR FATHER BUT ONE CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY OH I CAN SEE MYSELF ENJOYING THIS THEY GOT UP AND WANDERED BACK ALONG WIGGS'S PATH HAND IN HAND I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO LEAVE THE FOREST SAID HYACINTH
BE VERY CLOSE CORONEL SHE WHISPERED AND THEN THEY WALKED OUT TOGETHER IF ANY OF THE SERVANTS AT THE PALACE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE CORONEL THEY DID NOT SHOW IT AFTER ALL THAT WAS THEIR BUSINESS
NO DOUBT THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THAT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH BLESS HER PRETTY FACE HAD FOUND HER MAN AT LAST
IT WAS MORE THAN UDO DID JUST NOW HE WAS WITH HER IN HER GARDEN TELLING HER FOR THE FIFTH TIME AN EXTRAORDINARILY DULL STORY ABOUT AN ENCOUNTER OF HIS WITH A DRAGON APPARENTLY IN ITS DOTAGE TO WHICH BELVANE WAS LISTENING WITH AN INTEREST WHICH SURPRISED EVEN THE NARRATOR
AH WHAT A MIRACLE WORKER TRUE LOVE IS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH MADE BELVANE SO REMARKABLE WAS THAT SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID OF REMAINING SILENT WHEN SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO SAY
MORE THAN ADVISER SHE GUESSED TO HYACINTH HER OWN POSITION WOULD NOT BE IN MUCH DOUBT AND AS FOR THE KING IT MIGHT BE MONTHS BEFORE HE CAME BACK AND WHEN HE DID COME WOULD HE REMEMBER HER
SHE TOOK UNFLINCHING WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST SHOCK IN HER LIFE THEN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS READY IN THE PALACE SHE SAID IF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL EXCUSE ME
AND WITH A CURTSEY SHE WAS GONE CORONEL EXCHANGED A GLANCE WITH HYACINTH I'M ENJOYING THIS HE SEEMED TO SAY WELL SHE ANNOUNCED I MUST BE GOING IN TOO THERE'LL BE MUCH TO SEE ABOUT
AND NOW SAID THE PRINCE TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE CORONEL PUT HIS ARM IN UDO'S AND WALKED HIM UP AND DOWN THE FLAGGED PATH YOUR APPROACHING MARRIAGE
THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE WORD ABOUT IT MENTIONED UNTIL YOU PUSHED YOUR WAY IN JUST NOW
OH VERY WELL IF YOU'RE GOING TO DROP ALL YOUR FORMER FRIENDS GO ON THEN BUT WHEN I'M MARRIED THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A PLACE FOR UNDERSTAND ONCE AND FOR ALL SAID UDO ANGRILY THAT I AM NOT GETTING MARRIED NO DON'T TAKE MY ARM
SAID UDO STIFFLY WELL PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT I HOPE THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU ON THE WAY UDO WHO WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE PALACE TURNED ROUND WITH A STARTLED LOOK WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YES BUT OF COURSE THE CHANCE MIGHT COME AGAIN YOU'D HAVE THE THING HANGING OVER YOU ALWAYS SHE'S CLEVER YOU KNOW AND I SHOULD NEVER FEEL QUITE SAFE IF SHE WERE MY ENEMY LOVELY FLOWERS AREN'T THEY WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS ONE
OF OUR MOTHERS AND WIVES AND DAUGHTERS PROLONGED CHEERING AS THE CASE MAY BE HEAR HEAR
NO MATTER DEAR WE CAN EASILY FIND YOU PLENTY MORE SUITORS INDEED THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN VERY NEAR MY THOUGHTS LATELY WE'LL ARRANGE A LITTLE COMPETITION AND LET THEM KNOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES THERE'LL BE NO LACK OF CANDIDATES
MY DEAR THIS IS INDEED NEWS TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT UPON WHAT QUEST DID YOU SEND HIM HYACINTH HAD FELT THIS COMING
BY THE WAY WHO IS HE HE COMES FROM ARABY AND HIS NAME IS UDO OF COURSE WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF HIM AN EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENT MY DEAR IT ISN'T UDO I'M AFRAID FATHER IT'S CORONEL
NO IT'S NOT THE PRINCESS ELVIRA SAID HYACINTH A LITTLE NERVOUSLY THE KING LAUGHED GOOD HUMOUREDLY AH WELL YOU MUST TELL ME HE SAID
THERE WAS ANOTHER STORM OF CHEERS THE BATTLE CRY OF EURALIA HO HO MERRIWIG WAS SHOUTED FROM FIVE HUNDRED THROATS AND THE MEN DISPERSED HAPPILY TO THEIR HOMES HYACINTH AND MERRIWIG WENT INTO THE PALACE
BUT SHE WAS STILL ENGROSSED WITH THE WHISKERS
NOTHING MUCH I SUPPOSE HE WAITED NERVOUSLY WONDERING IF HYACINTH WOULD REALISE THAT ALL WAS MEANT TO INCLUDE MORE PARTICULARLY BELVANE HYACINTH DREW A STOOL UP TO HER FATHER'S CHAIR AND SAT DOWN VERY CLOSE TO HIM
MISS ELIZABETH REGARDED IT IN AFFECTIONATE ADMIRATION OF ITS BEAUTY MY DEAR SHE SAID TO THEODORA THAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FACE IN LONDON TO MY OLD EYES IT REMINDS ME OF MY DEAR ANASTASIA IN HER YOUTH I WAS ALWAYS GLAD MY BROTHER BENJAMIN'S DAUGHTER WAS NOT LIKE HIS WIFE
HE CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED IN AT HER ARE YOU COMING TO SEE PRISCILLA HE SAID LADY THROCKMORTON SAID I MIGHT SHE ANSWERED THE WARMTH IN HER FACE CHILLED BY HIS UNENTHUSIASTIC THOUGH KINDLY TONE SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT A STRUGGLE IT COST HIM TO FACE HER THUS CARELESSLY ALL AT ONCE
WE WERE NOT FOND OF MY BROTHER BENJAMIN'S WIFE SHE WAS A VERY GIDDY YOUNG PERSON AND VERY FOND OF GAYETY SHE DIED OF LUNG FEVER CONTRACTED THROUGH EXPOSING HERSELF ONE NIGHT AT A MILITARY BALL IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO MY BROTHER BENJAMIN'S WISHES
INDEED I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO WHEN I MUST LOSE HER AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO WHEN SHE MARRIES MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE YES MA'AM ANSWERED THEO AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE FELT A CURIOUS STARTLED GLOW FLASH OVER HER
IT WAS MIDNIGHT AFTER THE MEMORABLE DAY SPENT IN BROOME STREET THAT THE RECORD WAS MADE AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH SHUT THE BOOK WITH A STARTLED FEELING THAT SHE HAD SHUT WITHIN ITS PAGES AN UNFINISHED PAGE OF HER LIFE IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING TO HAVE COME UPON HER SO SUDDENLY
THIS WAS A CURIOUS CONSOLATION THE TWO SPENT HOURS TOGETHER SOMETIMES IN THE TINY PARLOR STUMBLING OVER BERLIN WOOL DIFFICULTIES AND NOW AND THEN WANDERING TO AND FRO CONVERSATIONALLY FROM PRISCILLA TO THE OCTAGON STITCH AND FROM THE OCTAGON STITCH TO DENIS
AND WHEN SHE HAD READ IT TOLD THE WHOLE STORY OF HER SISTER'S GENEROSITY IN A LITTLE BURST OF ENTHUSIASTIC LOVE AND GRATITUDE
THAT FAIRLY MELTED TENDER HEARTED OLD MISS ELIZABETH TO TEARS AND CAUSED HER TO CONFIDE AFTERWARD TO THEO THE FACT THAT SHE HERSELF HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THE TENDER PASSION IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A SINGLE GENTLEMAN OF UNCERTAIN AGE
THE VEHICLE DREW NEARER AND AT LENGTH STOPPED OPPOSITE THE HOUSE ON WHICH POLTON SLID DOWN THE STAIRS WITH THE AGILITY OF A HARLEQUIN A FEW MOMENTS LATER I HEARD HIS VOICE ASCENDING FROM THE HALL I DO HOPE SIR YOU'RE NOT MUCH HURT
AND HE SANK INTO HIS EASY CHAIR IN THE LIMP MANNER OF A MAN EITHER VERY WEAK OR VERY FATIGUED HOW DID IT HAPPEN I ASKED WHEN POLTON HAD CREPT AWAY ON TIP TOE TO MAKE READY FOR DINNER THORNDYKE LOOKED ROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS HENCHMAN HAD DEPARTED AND SAID
THE HORSES CAME STAMPING AND SLIDING STRAIGHT ON TO ME AND BEFORE I COULD WRIGGLE OUT OF THE WAY THE HOOF OF ONE OF THEM SMASHED IN MY HAT THAT WAS A NEW ONE THAT I CAME HOME IN AND HALF STUNNED ME THEN THE NEAR WHEEL STRUCK MY HEAD MAKING A DIRTY LITTLE SCALP WOUND AND PINNED DOWN MY SLEEVE SO THAT I COULDN'T PULL AWAY MY ARM
QUITE REPLIED THORNDYKE I HAVE ENTERTAINED IT FROM THE FIRST AND THE NEW FACTS THAT YOU HAVE GATHERED INCREASE ITS PROBABILITY YOU REMEMBER I SAID THAT FOUR HYPOTHESES WERE POSSIBLE THAT THE ROBBERY WAS COMMITTED EITHER BY REUBEN BY WALTER BY JOHN HORNBY OR BY SOME OTHER PERSON
THE FURTHER SLOPE AND BROUGHT THE CARRIAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PENINSULA WHERE THE GIRLS OBTAINED THEIR FIRST VIEW OF THE GULF OF SALERNO WITH THE LOVELY ISLES OF THE SIRENS LYING JUST BENEATH THEM
FROM THAT DISTANCE THE BOATS DRAWN UPON THE SHELTERED BEACH SEEMED LIKE MERE TOYS THEN THEY WOULD SPAN A CHASM ON A NARROW STONE BRIDGE OR PLUNGE THROUGH AN ARCH DIVIDING THE SOLID MOUNTAIN
NOW A HOTEL MUCH FAVORED BY THE TOURIST COUNT FERRALTI PROMISED TO JOIN THEM LATER AND RODE ON TO THE TOWN TO FIND A SURGEON TO LOOK AFTER HIS INJURED HAND WHILE THE OTHERS SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LONG INCLINES LEADING IN A ZIGZAG FASHION UP TO THE OLD MONASTERY
BEING SERVED BY THE OLD SERVANTS AS A MERE MATTER OF ROUTINE INDEED THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE HOUSEHOLD HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY CHANGED BY THE DEATH OF ITS MISTRESS AND WITHOUT ANY REAL HEAD TO DIRECT THEM THE SERVANTS WERE PATIENTLY AWAITING THE ADVENT OF A NEW MASTER OR MISTRESS
BUT BEING UNAWARE OF ITS IMPORT GAVE IT BUT PASSING ATTENTION THE MAIN SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION WAS AUNT JANE'S SURPRISING ACT IN ANNULLING HER LAST WILL AND FORCING PATRICIA TO ACCEPT THE INHERITANCE WHEN SHE DID NOT WANT IT
NO REPLIED UNCLE JOHN THE MERRICKS ARE OUT OF ELMHURST NOW AND IT RETURNS TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS YOU OWE ME NOTHING MY LAD

THERE'S DANNY REEVES'S RESTAURANT LET'S GET OFF AND HAVE OUR DINNER NOW I'M AS HUNGRY AS A BEAR SO THEY STOPPED THE CAR AND DESCENDED LUGGING ALL THE PARCELS INTO THE LITTLE RESTAURANT WHERE THEY WERE PILED INTO A CHAIR WHILE THE PROPRIETOR AND THE WAITERS ALL GATHERED AROUND PATSY TO WELCOME HER HOME
THERE WAS ONE GOOD SIZED LIVING ROOM WITH AN ANCIENT RAG CARPET PARTIALLY COVERING THE FLOOR A SHEET IRON STOVE A SOFA A TABLE AND THREE OR FOUR OLD FASHIONED CHAIRS THAT HAD PROBABLY COME FROM A SECOND HAND DEALER
OPENING FROM THIS WERE TWO CLOSET LIKE ROOMS CONTAINING EACH A BED AND A CHAIR WITH A WASH BASIN ON A BRACKET SHELF ON THE WAILS WERE A FEW COLORED PRINTS FROM THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS AND ONE LARGE AND FINE PHOTOGRAPH OF A GRIZZLED OLD SOLDIER
BY THE BYE ADDED THE MAJOR IF YOU HAVE ANY MONEY ABOUT YOU WHICH IS JUST POSSIBLE SIR OF COURSE YOU'D BETTER TURN IT OVER TO PATSY TO KEEP AND LET HER MAKE YOU AN ALLOWANCE THAT'S THE WAY I DO IT'S VERY SATISFACTORY THE MAJOR'S EXTRAVAGANT EXCLAIMED PATSY

THANK YOU PATSY SAID UNCLE JOHN MEEKLY AND GATHERED UP HIS FORTY TWO CENTS YOU'VE NOW A HOME AND A MANAGER SIR WITH MONEY IN THE BANK OF PATSY AND COMPANY LIMITED

AND ASKED HER TO TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT THE LETTER ANNETTA CRIED AND FESSED UP FREELY SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER WRITTEN A LETTER AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO OR WHAT TO SAY
THERE IS NOTHING WEAK OR GIRLISH ABOUT HIM IN SPITE OF HIS DREAMS AND FANCIES HE IS VERY MANLY AND CAN HOLD HIS OWN IN ALL GAMES HE FOUGHT SAINT CLAIR DONNELL RECENTLY BECAUSE SAINT CLAIR SAID THE UNION JACK WAS AWAY AHEAD OF THE STARS AND STRIPES AS A FLAG
A MOONGLADE IS THE TRACK THE FULL MOON MAKES ON THE WATER WHEN IT IS RISING FROM THE SEA YOU KNOW TEACHER WELL THE YOUNGEST TWIN SAILOR SAILED ALONG THE MOONGLADE TILL HE CAME RIGHT UP TO THE MOON
BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT WAS ONLY THE WIND AMONG THE ROCKS I'VE NEVER TOLD NORA ABOUT THE GOLDEN LADY I WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT HURT HER FEELINGS IT EVEN HURT HER FEELINGS IF I TALKED TOO LONG WITH THE TWIN SAILORS I ALWAYS MET THE TWIN SAILORS AT THE STRIPED ROCKS
THE OLDEST TWIN CAME SAILING OVER THE SEA IN AN ENCHANTED BOAT AND I GOT IN HER THE BOAT WAS ALL PEARLY AND RAINBOWY LIKE THE INSIDE OF THE MUSSEL SHELLS AND HER SAIL WAS LIKE MOONSHINE WELL WE SAILED RIGHT ACROSS TO THE SUNSET
ANNE TOOK HER POINTER FROM HER DESK IT WAS A LONG HEAVY HARDWOOD POINTER COME HERE ANTHONY IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT ANTHONY PYE HAD EVER UNDERGONE ANNE
SHE WENT TO SCHOOL IN NO ANGELIC MOOD HER CHEEK WAS SWOLLEN AND HER FACE ACHED THE SCHOOLROOM WAS COLD AND SMOKY FOR THE FIRE REFUSED TO BURN AND THE CHILDREN WERE HUDDLED ABOUT IT IN SHIVERING GROUPS

RATHER ODD COMMENTED MISTER JENKS BLACK PAPER AND WHITE INK WHITE INK IS EASY ENOUGH TO MAKE STATED MISTER PARKER
TOGETHER WITH THE ANTICS OF THE THING IN WHITE LAST NIGHT SHOWS THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF OUR PRESENCE HERE AND PERHAPS KNOW WHO WE ARE WE WILL HAVE TO BE ON OUR GUARD DO YOU THINK THAT FELLOW MUNSON
THEY RATHER EXPECTED TO SEE THE THING IN WHITE AGAIN THAT NIGHT BUT IT DID NOT APPEAR AND MORNING CAME WITHOUT ANYTHING HAVING DISTURBED THEIR HEAVY SLEEP FOR THEY WERE TIRED FROM THE DAY'S TRAMP
AT TIMES IT WOULD BE ONLY DIMLY VISIBLE IN THE BLACKNESS THEN SUDDENLY IT WOULD STAND OUT IN BOLD RELIEF AS A GREAT FLASH OF FIRE SPLIT THE CLOUDS THE THUNDER MEANWHILE
IN HER OPINION THE CONSTANT CONSUMPTION OF MALT LIQUORS PREVENTS A MORE DANGEROUS INDULGENCE IN BRANDY AND WHISKY SHE IS GATHERING STATISTICS BUT AS THE BARMAIDS CAN NEVER COLLECT THEIR THOUGHTS WHILE THEY ARE DRAWING ALE
I HAVE A PLAN TO PROPOSE I WAS HERE LAST SUMMER WITH A COUPLE OF HARVARD MEN AND WE LODGED AT A FARMHOUSE ABOUT A MILE DISTANT FROM THE CATHEDRAL IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE COFFEE ROOM FOR AN HOUR
I AM SO HAPPY THAT I FEEL AS IF SOMETHING WERE GOING TO SPOIL IT ALL TWENTY YEARS OLD TO DAY I WISH MAMMA WERE ALIVE TO WISH ME MANY HAPPY RETURNS THE CATHEDRAL IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF
BY HOLDING HER TO MY HEART AND KISSING HER LOVELY HAIR REASSURINGLY AS I MURMURED YOU ARE SAFE MY DARLING NOT A HAIR OF YOUR PRECIOUS HEAD SHALL BE HURT DON'T BE FRIGHTENED SHE SHIVERED LIKE A LEAF
GO DEAR MISTER SLICK KISSED HIM ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO TO THE STATES ALONG WITH HIM TOLD HIM ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM FOR THEY DIDN'T SEE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FACE ONCE IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS BLACK EYES LET ME SEE
WHERE THE FIRE WAS NOW BLAZING UP BUT MISTER SLICK PROTESTED HE COULD NOT PROCEED WITHOUT THE LITTLE BOY AND LINGERED BEHIND TO ASCERTAIN HIS AGE AND CONCLUDED BY ASKING THE CHILD IF HE HAD ANY AUNTS THAT LOOKED LIKE MAMA
NEITHER AT DINNER ON THAT EVENING AT MANCHESTER SQUARE NOR AFTER DINNER AS LONG AS MISSUS ROBY REMAINED IN THE HOUSE WAS A WORD SAID ABOUT LOPEZ BY MISTER WHARTON HE REMAINED LONGER THAN USUAL WITH HIS BOTTLE OF PORT WINE IN THE DINING ROOM
THERE HAD HOWEVER BEEN A FEW WORDS SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT BETWEEN MISSUS ROBY AND HER NIECE WHICH HAD SERVED TO PREPARE EMILY FOR WHAT WAS COMING LOPEZ HAS BEEN TO YOUR FATHER
TO THOSE WHO WERE ALLOWED TO LOVE HER NO WOMAN WAS MORE LOVABLE THERE WAS INNATE IN HER AN APPRECIATION OF HER OWN POSITION AS A WOMAN AND WITH IT A PRINCIPLE OF SELF DENIAL AS A HUMAN BEING WHICH IT WAS BEYOND THE POWER OF ANY MISSUS ROBY TO DESTROY
AND DECLARED AS SHE ALWAYS DID ON SUCH OCCASIONS THAT SHE COULD GO ROUND THE CORNER WITHOUT HAVING ANY ONE TO LOOK AFTER HER
I HAVE NEVER SAID SO BEFORE TO ANY ONE I WOULD NOT SAY SO TO YOU NOW IF HE HAD NOT SPOKEN TO YOU AS HE HAS DONE EMILY IT MUST NOT BE WHY NOT PAPA IF YOU SAY IT SHALL NOT BE SO IT SHALL NOT
DID YOU EVER HEAR THIS MAN SPEAK OF HIS FATHER I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER DID OR HIS MOTHER OR HIS FAMILY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS SUSPICIOUS
ALREADY PRONOUNCED YOU KNOW PAPA THAT I TRUST YOU SHE SAID AND I HAVE PROMISED YOU THAT I WILL NOT DISOBEY YOU
IF IT IS ONLY BECAUSE MISTER LOPEZ HAS A FOREIGN NAME IT ISN'T ONLY THAT NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HIM OR WHERE TO INQUIRE EVEN I THINK YOU SHOULD INQUIRE PAPA AND BE QUITE CERTAIN BEFORE YOU PRONOUNCE SUCH A SENTENCE AGAINST ME
I AM SURE YOU BELIEVE ME WHEN I PROMISE NOT TO SEE HIM WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION I DO BELIEVE YOU OF COURSE I BELIEVE YOU BUT IF I DO THAT FOR YOU PAPA I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY SURE ON MY ACCOUNT
IT'S A PITY SHE SHOULD NOT REMEMBER HERS IN THE WAY SHE DRESSES SAID THE DUCHESS THIS WAS MARVELLOUS TO HIM THAT HIS WIFE
THAT HER ANGER ABOUT THE ROBES WAS APPEASED I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASKED ABOUT A FRIEND OF YOURS HE SAID THIS OCCURRED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL AND PERFECTED LIST OF THE NEW MEN HAD APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT FRIEND
AND FURTHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS ALL MEN KNEW WHO KNEW ANYTHING BUT FOR THE MOMENT FOR THE MONTH EVEN PERHAPS FOR THE SESSION THERE WAS TO BE PEACE WITH FULL LATITUDE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ROUTINE DUTIES THERE WAS SO TO SAY NO OPPOSITION
ALL IN SUCH A RAMPANT STATE THAT BUSY MOTHERS WONDERED HOW THEY EVER SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR FRISKY DARLINGS OUT OF MISCHIEF THRIFTY FATHERS PLANNED HOW THEY COULD BRIBE THE IDLE HANDS TO PICK BERRIES OR RAKE HAY AND THE OLD FOLKS
WHO FELT BITTERLY TOWARD ALL MANKIND AT THAT INSTANT BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS NO HOPE OF HIS GOING SAY THAT AGAIN AND I'LL KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF AND BEN FACED ROUND WITH A GESTURE WHICH CAUSED THE OTHER TO SKIP OUT OF REACH PRECIPITATELY
THERE S BAB SHE'LL DO IT COME HERE SISSY BEN WANTS YOU CALLED SAM BECKONING TO A SMALL FIGURE JUST PERCHING ON THE FENCE DOWN IT JUMPED AND CAME FLUTTERING UP
HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE ASKED LEAVE TO GO AND BEEN KINDER TO BAB
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF YOU HADN'T FOUND US ASKED BILLY FORGETTING HIS IMPATIENCE IN HIS ADMIRATION FOR THIS PLUCKY YOUNG LADY I'D HAVE GONE ON AND SEEN THE CIRCUS
MOSTLY BARE THAT EXTENDS FROM NEAR THE CAMP GROUND AT THE TIMBERLINE BUT ON MY FIRST EXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO ITS LOW SWELLING BASE WAS SMOOTHLY LADEN WITH LOOSE FRESH SNOW
THE SNOW WAS TOO LOOSE AND DEEP TO CLIMB AND I SHOULD BE LOST IN DRIFTS AND SLIDES WHEN I HINTED THAT NEW SNOW WAS BEAUTIFUL AND STORMS NOT SO BAD AS THEY WERE CALLED MY ADVISERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN TOKEN OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
AND SHED A BLAZE OF LIGHT ON THE WILD LAVA SLOPE AND THE STRAGGLING STORM BENT PINES AROUND US MELTED SNOW ANSWERED FOR COFFEE AND WE HAD PLENTY OF VENISON TO ROAST TOWARD MIDNIGHT I ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS SLEPT AN HOUR AND A HALF
AND I TOLD JEROME THAT WE TWO MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR WAY DOWN THROUGH ANY STORM LIKELY TO FALL PRESENTLY THIN FIBROUS FILMS OF CLOUD BEGAN TO BLOW DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
AND HE MUST SURELY HAVE PERISHED AND SISSON WAS BLAMED FOR ALLOWING ANY ONE TO ATTEMPT CLIMBING IN SUCH WEATHER WHILE I WAS AS SAFE AS ANYBODY IN THE LOWLANDS LYING LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A WARM FLUFFY NEST BUSIED ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS AND WISHING ONLY TO BE LET ALONE
AND IN MANY PLACES REACHED THE SKIN WE WERE GLAD AT FIRST TO SEE THE SNOW PACKING ABOUT US HOPING IT WOULD DEADEN THE FORCE OF THE WIND BUT IT SOON FROZE INTO A STIFF CRUSTY HEAP AS THE TEMPERATURE FELL RATHER AUGMENTING OUR NOVEL MISERY
IN OUR FROZEN AND BROILED CONDITION SEEMED CERTAIN DEATH THE ACRID INCRUSTATIONS SUBLIMED FROM THE ESCAPING GASES FREQUENTLY GAVE WAY OPENING NEW VENTS TO SCALD US AND FEARING THAT IF AT ANY TIME THE WIND SHOULD FALL
EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS FOR THE SCALDING GAS JETS WERE SHORN OFF CLOSE TO THE GROUND BY THE OVERSWEEPING FLOOD OF FROSTY WIND AND HOW LAVISHLY THE SNOW FELL ONLY MOUNTAINEERS MAY KNOW THE CRISP CRYSTAL FLOWERS
THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
ONLY THE CHILDREN HAILED THEM WITH DELIGHT THE OLD LATTER DAYS SEEMED TO SHUN THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW MISTER YOUNG THE LAKE PROPHET WOULD MEET SUCH MESSENGERS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STORM
LOOKING ACROSS THE JORDAN THE GRAY SAGEY SLOPES FROM THE BASE OF THE OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PLUSHY CLOTH OF GOLD SOFT AND ETHEREAL AS A CLOUD NOT MERELY TINTED AND GILDED LIKE A ROCK WITH AUTUMN SUNSHINE BUT DEEPLY MUFFLED BEYOND RECOGNITION
EARTH AND SKY ROUND AND ROUND THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE WAS ONE RAVISHING REVELATION OF COLOR INFINITELY VARIED AND INTERBLENDED I HAVE SEEN MANY A GLORIOUS SUNSET BENEATH LIFTING STORM CLOUDS ON THE MOUNTAINS
BUT NOTHING COMPARABLE WITH THIS I FELT AS IF NEW ARRIVED IN SOME OTHER FAR OFF WORLD THE MOUNTAINS THE PLAINS THE SKY ALL SEEMED NEW OTHER EXPERIENCES SEEMED BUT TO HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS AS SOULS ARE PREPARED FOR HEAVEN
BUT YOU MAY NOT SEE A SINGLE TRUE LILY AND ONLY A VERY FEW LILIACEOUS PLANTS OF ANY KIND NOT EVEN IN THE COOL FRESH GLENS OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL YOU FIND THESE FAVORITE FLOWERS THOUGH SOME OF THESE DESERT RANGES ALMOST RIVAL THE SIERRA IN HEIGHT
AND WHILE PLANTING THE PLAINS WITH SAGE AND THE HILLS WITH CEDAR SHE HAS COVERED AT LEAST ONE MOUNTAIN WITH GOLDEN ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS AS ITS CROWNING GLORY AS IF WILLING TO SHOW WHAT SHE COULD DO IN THE LILY LINE EVEN HERE
FOR TO IT HUNDREDS OF THEM OWE THEIR LIVES DURING THE FAMINE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT GREAT DESTITUTION PREVAILED ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN SETTLEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DROUTH AND GRASSHOPPERS
AND RELATIONS LIE BLEEDING OUT THEIR HEART BLOOD UPON THE GROUND THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS CHOPPED INTO THE HEAD WITH A HATCHET AND STRIPPED NAKED
AS IF THEY WOULD HAVE TORN OUR VERY HEARTS OUT YET THE LORD BY HIS ALMIGHTY POWER PRESERVED A NUMBER OF US FROM DEATH FOR THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR OF US TAKEN ALIVE AND CARRIED CAPTIVE I HAD OFTEN BEFORE THIS SAID THAT IF THE INDIANS SHOULD COME
SOME ONE WAY AND SOME ANOTHER THERE WERE NOW BESIDES MYSELF NINE ENGLISH CAPTIVES IN THIS PLACE ALL OF THEM CHILDREN EXCEPT ONE WOMAN
THIS WAS A SWEET CORDIAL TO ME WHEN I WAS READY TO FAINT MANY AND MANY A TIME HAVE I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SWEETLY OVER THIS SCRIPTURE AT THIS PLACE WE CONTINUED ABOUT FOUR DAYS THE FIFTH REMOVE
AND AN EXCEEDING HIGH AND STEEP HILL BEFORE IT BEFORE I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL I THOUGHT MY HEART AND LEGS AND ALL WOULD HAVE BROKEN AND FAILED ME WHAT THROUGH FAINTNESS AND SORENESS OF BODY IT WAS A GRIEVOUS DAY OF TRAVEL TO ME
AND HE LIGHTED UPON THAT COMFORTABLE SCRIPTURE I SHALL NOT DIE BUT LIVE AND DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD
AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD SMOKE IT A USUAL COMPLIMENT NOWADAYS AMONGST SAINTS AND SINNERS BUT THIS NO WAY SUITED ME FOR THOUGH I HAD FORMERLY USED TOBACCO YET I HAD LEFT IT EVER SINCE I WAS FIRST TAKEN
I PRAY GOD HE MAY REMEMBER THESE THINGS NOW HE IS RETURNED IN SAFETY AT THIS PLACE THE SUN NOW GETTING HIGHER WHAT WITH THE BEAMS AND HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE SMOKE OF THE WIGWAMS I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLIND
BUT HE LIVING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO FETCH WATER I WOULD OFTEN BE PUTTING OF HIM IN MIND AND CALLING FOR MY PAY AT LAST HE TOLD ME IF I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER SHIRT FOR A PAPOOSE NOT YET BORN HE WOULD GIVE ME A KNIFE WHICH HE DID WHEN I HAD DONE IT
I TURNED HOMEWARD AGAIN AND MET WITH MY MASTER HE SHOWED ME THE WAY TO MY SON WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND HIM NOT WELL AND WITHALL HE HAD A BOIL ON HIS SIDE WHICH MUCH TROUBLED HIM WE BEMOANED ONE ANOTHER A WHILE AS THE LORD HELPED US
BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD PSALM FORTY SIX
WAS I FAIN TO STOOP TO THIS RUDE FELLOW AND TO GO OUT IN THE NIGHT I KNEW NOT WHITHER MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THAT FELLOW AFTERWARDS WALKING UP AND DOWN BOSTON UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF A FRIEND INDIAN AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE LIKE CUT
THAT WHATSOEVER THE INDIANS TOLD ME RESPECTING HIM WAS VANITY AND LIES SOME OF THEM TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD AND THEY HAD KILLED HIM SOME SAID HE WAS MARRIED AGAIN AND THAT THE GOVERNOR WISHED HIM TO MARRY AND TOLD HIM HE SHOULD HAVE HIS CHOICE
THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE BUT THE PIRATE WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL AND THE SENTINEL WAS SOON DEAD THEN CARRYING HIS TWO JARS BARTHOLEMY CLIMBED SWIFTLY AND NOISELESSLY UP THE SHORT LADDER
AND HE HAD NO WINE JARS NOW WITH WHICH TO BUOY HIMSELF UP
FOR AS HAS BEEN SAID SUCH VESSELS WERE CONTINUALLY PLYING ABOUT THOSE SHALLOW WATERS THE CANOES WERE HAILED AND AFTER HAVING GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIRATE SHIP UPON THE COAST
CHAPTER THIRTEEN A RESURRECTED PIRATE
BUT NOW THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO ALTER HIS PLANS THE ORDINARY PERSON IN COMMAND OF TWO SMALL BOATS WHO SHOULD SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT A VILLAGE WHICH HE SUPPOSED ALMOST DEFENCELESS WAS PROTECTED BY A LARGE MAN OF WAR
AND HE ALSO NEEDED A LARGER FORCE THAN HE HAD WITH HIM AND HE THEREFORE CAPTURED SOME MEN WHO WERE FISHING ALONG THE COAST AND PUT THEM INTO HIS CANOES TO HELP WORK THE OARS THEN BY NIGHT HE PROCEEDED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPANISH VESSEL
THIS MAN WHO WAS NOT A SOLDIER WAS DESPERATELY FRIGHTENED AND BEGGED PITEOUSLY FOR HIS LIFE L'OLONNOIS FINDING THAT THE MAN WAS WILLING TO TELL EVERYTHING HE KNEW QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE SENDING OF THIS VESSEL FROM HAVANA
CUT OFF HIS HEAD LIKEWISE AND HIS BODY WAS TUMBLED INTO THE SEA AFTER THOSE OF HIS COMPANIONS NOW THERE WAS NOT A SPANIARD LEFT ON BOARD THE GREAT SHIP EXCEPT ONE MAN
BUT WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF HAVANA AND THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES HEARD OF THIS TERRIBLE RESOLUTION OF THEIR GOVERNOR THEY WERE VERY MUCH DISTURBED THEY LIVED IN CONSTANT DANGER OF ATTACK ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN FISHING OR MARITIME PURSUITS
THE YOUTH NEVERTHELESS FELT A THREAT HIS MIND SHRANK FROM GOING NEAR TO THE DANGER AND THEREAFTER HE WAS SILENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SARCASTIC MAN'S WORDS TOOK FROM HIM ALL LOUD MOODS THAT WOULD MAKE HIM APPEAR PROMINENT
THERE WAS A MIGHTY SONG OF CLASHES AND CRASHES THAT WENT SWEEPING THROUGH THE WOODS THE GUNS IN THE REAR AROUSED AND ENRAGED BY SHELLS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN BURR LIKE AT THEM SUDDENLY INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN A HIDEOUS ALTERCATION WITH ANOTHER BAND OF GUNS
THE BATTLE ROAR SETTLED TO A ROLLING THUNDER WHICH WAS A SINGLE LONG EXPLOSION IN THE REGIMENT THERE WAS A PECULIAR KIND OF HESITATION DENOTED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE MEN
VEX YOU OLD MAN YOU EXPECT ME TO KEEP MY VEXATIONS TO MYSELF BUT YOU LIE LAY OLD GIRL I SAY LIE YOUR BURDENS ON MY SHOULDERS TOO WAS THAT WHAT YOU PROMISED ME WHEN WE GOT MARRIED
NO SHE HASN'T MAY I ASK WHAT YOUR PROPERTY IS OF WHICH YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DISPOSE HALF OF YOUR'S OLD MAN MY DOWRY THE DEVIL WHO TAUGHT YOU SUCH RUBBISH IT'S NOT RUBBISH IT'S THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE MY DEAR
EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD SOME CONNEXION WITH WHAT HAD BEEN SAID OR COULD BE BROUGHT INTO CONNEXION WITH IT FALK WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE REASON FOR FINDING FAULT WITH THE BREAKFAST SO AS TO HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR EXPRESSING INDIGNATION
I'M KNOWN THERE WELL THE SHOEMAKERS BANK THE TAILORS BANK ANY ONE YOU LIKE ONLY DO BE QUICK ABOUT IT THEY FINALLY ACCEPTED THE JOINERS BANK AND NOW SAID FALK WITH A LOOK AS IF HE HAD BOUGHT THE OTHER'S SOUL
NOW YOU HAD BETTER GO AND ORDER A NEW SUIT BUT I WANT YOU TO ORDER IT AT A MILITARY TAILOR'S SO THAT THEY WILL SUPPLY YOU LATER ON WITH A UNIFORM ON CREDIT UNIFORM
YES AND ANOTHER THING TRY TO MEET MY BROTHER FIND OUT ALL YOU CAN ABOUT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES AND FRIENDS MAKE UP TO HIM WORM YOURSELF INTO HIS CONFIDENCE THE LATTER'S AN EASY JOB BECOME HIS FRIEND TELL HIM THAT I'VE CHEATED HIM
SPREADING NETS FOR HAMLET AT POLONIUS'S ADVICE HE ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE AWAY THE THOUGHT AND INSTEAD OF AGNES HE SAW THE COQUETTISH MISS JACQUETTE WHO HAD BEEN THE LAST TO PLAY THE PART AT THE MUNICIPAL THEATRE
HE DRESSED HASTILY AND AS HE PICKED UP HIS BOOT A BIG SPIDER RAN ACROSS THE FLOOR THE SIGHT PLEASED HIM FOR HE BELIEVED IN THE SUPERSTITION THAT A SPIDER IS A HARBINGER OF HAPPINESS
AND WAS MAKING VIOLENT EFFORTS TO REGAIN IT I SAW A SPIDER THIS MORNING SAID REHNHJELM THAT PREDICTS HAPPINESS ARAIGNEE MATIN CHAGRIN SAID FALANDER HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ASKED AGNES A SPIDER ON THE MORROW GRIEF AND SORROW
WHAT'S THAT LAUGHED AGNES OPENING THE BOX AND TAKING OUT A SIX BARRELLED REVOLVER I SAY WHAT A SWEET THING
THEY WENT TO THE VAULTS AND ENGAGED A PRIVATE ROOM WHERE BREAKFAST WAS SERVED TO THEM HAS MY HAIR TURNED GREY ASKED REHNHJELM PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS HAIR WHICH WAS DAMP AND CLUNG CLOSELY TO HIS SKULL NO OLD MAN THAT DOESN'T OFTEN HAPPEN EVEN I'M NOT GREY
THE PROFESSOR OF LANDSCAPE PAINTING HAD TOLD HIM AS A FRIEND THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE A GREAT ARTIST AND THE ACADEMICIAN HAD SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REHABILITATE HIMSELF AND CLUNG TO HIS FIRST OPINION IN ADDITION TO THIS THE PUBLIC TASTE IN PICTURES HAD CHANGED
HAD EITHER TO DRAW HIS KNEES UP TO HIS CHIN OR ALLOW HIS LEGS TO DANGLE OVER THE SIDE THE BEDDING CONSISTED OF HALF A RUG THE OTHER HALF WAS AT THE PAWNBROKER'S AND A LEATHER CASE STUFFED TO BURSTING POINT WITH STUDIES AND SKETCHES
AND THE NOTES THERE ARE SO FEW IN CIRCULATION I SEE THEY WON'T ISSUE ANY MORE AND THE VALUABLES
I MUST TRY AND GET WORK TO DAY AT A STONE MASON'S OR I SHALL STARVE
HIS HEAD WAS HANGING OVER ONE OF THE SIDE RAILINGS WHICH SUPPORTED HIS THICK NECK AND HIS LEGS OVER THE OTHER POOR DEVIL MUTTERED SELLEN COVERING HIM UP WITH HIS RUG THERE WAS ANOTHER KNOCK BUT AS IT WAS UNFAMILIAR SELLEN JUDGED IT WISE TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF IT
WHEN ALL SHAKING WAS IN VAIN BORG TOOK THE TONGS WHICH WERE NOW RED HOT AND HELD THEM UNDER THE SLEEPER'S NOSTRILS WAKE UP YOU DOG
BUT NOW THAT STRUVE HAS BEEN PROCEEDED AGAINST WE MUST FIND A SUBSTITUTE IT'S A SAFE OLD LOAN AND THERE ARE NO RISKS THE MONEY WAS DUE A YEAR AGO FALK SIGNED AND THE OTHER TWO WITNESSED
THEY RIGHTLY DO INHERIT HEAVEN'S GRACES AND HUSBAND NATURE'S RICHES FROM EXPENSE THEY ARE THE LORDS AND OWNERS OF THEIR FACES OTHERS BUT STEWARDS OF THEIR EXCELLENCE
WHAT OLD DECEMBER'S BARENESS EVERYWHERE AND YET THIS TIME REMOVED WAS SUMMER'S TIME THE TEEMING AUTUMN BIG WITH RICH INCREASE BEARING THE WANTON BURDEN OF THE PRIME
YET SEEM'D IT WINTER STILL AND YOU AWAY AS WITH YOUR SHADOW I WITH THESE DID PLAY
THE FORWARD VIOLET THUS DID I CHIDE SWEET THIEF WHENCE DIDST THOU STEAL THY SWEET THAT SMELLS IF NOT FROM MY LOVE'S BREATH
BUT FOR HIS THEFT IN PRIDE OF ALL HIS GROWTH A VENGEFUL CANKER EAT HIM UP TO DEATH
SING TO THE EAR THAT DOTH THY LAYS ESTEEM AND GIVES THY PEN BOTH SKILL AND ARGUMENT
MY ATTEMPTS TO WALK RESULTED IN A VARIETY OF HOPS WHICH TOOK ME CLEAR OF THE GROUND A COUPLE OF FEET AT EACH STEP AND LANDED ME SPRAWLING UPON MY FACE OR BACK
AND BENEATH THIS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED LARGE EGGS PERFECTLY ROUND AND SNOWY WHITE THE EGGS WERE NEARLY UNIFORM IN SIZE BEING ABOUT TWO AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER FIVE OR SIX HAD ALREADY HATCHED
WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THE HEAD THE EARS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE EYES AND CLOSER TOGETHER WERE SMALL CUP SHAPED ANTENNAE PROTRUDING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH ON THESE YOUNG SPECIMENS
MAKING THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SINGULARLY FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE MOST OF THESE DETAILS I NOTED LATER FOR I WAS GIVEN BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPECULATE ON THE WONDERS OF MY NEW DISCOVERY
AS TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTT OF HIS GREAT METAL SHOD SPEAR I SHOULD HAVE SNUFFED OUT WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT DEATH WAS NEAR ME BUT THE LITTLE SOUND CAUSED ME TO TURN
OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
TO LOOK UPON ME WITH LESS FEROCITY BUT AS I WAS TO LEARN LATER THE THING WHICH WEIGHED MOST IN MY FAVOR WAS MY EXHIBITION OF HURDLING WHILE THE MARTIANS ARE IMMENSE THEIR BONES ARE VERY LARGE
AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
WHEN HE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF ME HE UNCLASPED AN ENORMOUS METAL ARMLET AND HOLDING IT TOWARD ME IN THE OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ADDRESSED ME IN A CLEAR RESONANT VOICE
IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
GAY COLORED FEATHERS AND BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT LEATHER TRAPPINGS INGENIOUSLY SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES FROM HIS SHOULDERS DEPENDED A SHORT CAPE OF WHITE FUR LINED WITH BRILLIANT SCARLET SILK WHAT STRUCK ME AS MOST REMARKABLE
WHEREAS THE GREAT BULKS OF THE MARTIANS
AND THEN CARRY IT OUT IN SPITE OF ALL OPPOSITION BUT TO TAKE PATSY TO EUROPE WOULD BE LIKE PULLING THE MAJOR'S EYE TEETH OR AMPUTATING HIS GOOD RIGHT ARM WORSE FAR WORSE IT WOULD MEAN TAKING THE SUNSHINE OUT OF HER OLD FATHER'S SKY ALTOGETHER
THE IMPRESSION CONVEYED WAS THAT YOU SNORED LIKE A MAN THAT HAS FORGOTTEN HIS MANNERS AN GONE TO SLEEP IN THE PRISENCE OF A LADY THEN NO ONE HAS A BETTER RIGHT TO DO THAT DECLARED PATSY SOOTHINGLY AND I'M SURE OUR DEAR UNCLE JOHN'S THOUGHTS
YOU'RE DREAMING AGAIN PATSY SWUNG HER FEET FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR SHE WAS SUCH A LITTLE THING THAT THE STOOL RAISED HER ENTIRELY OFF THE FLOOR THERE WAS A THOUGHTFUL LOOK ON HER ROUND FRECKLED FACE AND A WISTFUL ONE IN HER GREAT BLUE EYES
I WILL ASK YOU TO EXPLAIN TO US SIR THE BRUTAL SUGGESTION YOU HAVE JUST ADVANCED UNCLE JOHN LAUGHED IN THE DAYS WHEN MAJOR DOYLE HAD THOUGHT HIM A POOR MAN AND IN NEED OF A HELPING HAND
AND THE RESULT IS AN ACCUMULATION OF ALL THIS DREADFUL MONEY SO MY DEAR MAJOR
AND EUROPE'LL OPEN YOUR EYES AND PROVE TO YOU HOW INSIGNIFICANT YOU REALLY ARE I ADVISE YOU TO VISIT IRELAND SOR WHICH I'M RELIABLY INFORMED IS THE CENTHRAL JEWEL IN EUROPE'S CROWN OF BEAUTY GO
WOULD YOU KEEP HER HERE TO CUDDLE AND SPOIL A VIGOROUS MAN LIKE YOURSELF WHEN SHE CAN RUN AWAY AND SEE THE WORLD AND BE HAPPY IT'S A GREAT HAPPINESS TO CUDDLE THE MAJOR SAID PATSY SOFTLY AND THE POOR MAN NEEDS IT AS MUCH AS HE DOES HIS SLIPPERS
AND MIGHT BE A BIT LONESOME WITHOUT HER BUT I'LL SETTLE THAT FOOLISHNESS SIR IN SHORT ORDER YOU SHALL GO WITH US IMPOSSIBLE EJACULATED THE MAJOR IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR I'M MOST NEEDED IN THE OFFICE
PERHAPS SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE SENSIBLE SUGGESTED THE MAJOR WELL I'LL SEE HER AND HER MOTHER TO MORROW MORNING DECIDED UNCLE JOHN
YOU AND BETH SHALL GO ANYHOW AND WE'LL BRING LOUISE A WEDDING PRESENT WITH THIS DECLARATION HE TOOK HIS HAT AND WALKING STICK AND STARTED FOR THE TELEGRAPH STATION LEAVING PATSY AND HER FATHER TO CANVASS THE UNEXPECTED SITUATION
BUT LOUISE IS WELL QUITE WELL THANK YOU THAT'S A GREAT RELIEF FOR I'M GOING TO TAKE HER TO EUROPE WITH ME NEXT WEEK HE SAID MISSUS MERRICK WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE NEARLY DROPPED HER COFFEE CUP
A CHAPERONE INDEED MISSUS MERRICK HELD UP HER HANDS IN HORROR I'M NOT SURE JOHN SHE GASPED THAT I OUGHT TO TRUST MY DEAR CHILD WITH AN UNCLE WHO DISREGARDS SO OPENLY THE PROPRIETIES
SO THE POT WAS PLACED IN SAFETY
MY COUSIN HAS BROUGHT A LITTLE SON INTO THE WORLD AND HAS ASKED ME TO BE GODMOTHER HE IS WHITE WITH BROWN SPOTS AND I AM TO HOLD HIM OVER THE FONT AT THE CHRISTENING
THE CAT HAD NO COUSIN AND HAD NOT BEEN ASKED TO BE GODMOTHER SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CHURCH STOLE TO THE POT OF FAT BEGAN TO LICK AT IT AND LICKED THE TOP OF THE FAT OFF THEN SHE TOOK A WALK UPON THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN LOOKED OUT FOR OPPORTUNITIES
YOU HAVE DEVOURED ALL WHEN YOU WERE STANDING GODMOTHER FIRST TOP OFF THEN HALF DONE THEN WILL YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE CRIED THE CAT
FUNDEVOGEL THERE WAS ONCE A FORESTER WHO WENT INTO THE FOREST TO HUNT AND AS HE ENTERED IT HE HEARD A SOUND OF SCREAMING AS IF A LITTLE CHILD WERE THERE HE FOLLOWED THE SOUND AND AT LAST CAME TO A HIGH TREE AND AT THE TOP OF THIS A LITTLE CHILD WAS SITTING
YOU FOOLS WHY DID YOU NOT PULL THE CHURCH TO PIECES AND BRING THE CHANDELIER HOME WITH YOU AND NOW THE OLD COOK HERSELF GOT ON HER LEGS AND WENT WITH THE THREE SERVANTS IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW FROM AFAR THAT THE THREE SERVANTS WERE COMING
THE LITTLE PEASANT THERE WAS A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHEREIN NO ONE LIVED BUT REALLY RICH PEASANTS AND JUST ONE POOR ONE WHOM THEY CALLED THE LITTLE PEASANT HE HAD NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A COW AND STILL LESS MONEY TO BUY ONE
THERE IS SUCH A STORM IT LOOKS AS IF THE WORLD WERE COMING TO AN END THE MILLER SAW THE PEASANT LYING ON THE STRAW AND ASKED WHAT IS THAT FELLOW DOING THERE AH SAID THE WIFE THE POOR KNAVE CAME IN THE STORM AND RAIN AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
AND RAN HOME KILLED ALL THEIR COWS AND STRIPPED OFF THEIR SKINS IN ORDER TO SELL THEM IN THE TOWN TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE THE MAYOR HOWEVER SAID BUT MY SERVANT MUST GO FIRST
NO I WILL NOT DO IT IF THE WHOLE WORLD INSISTS ON IT I WILL NOT DO IT THE SHEPHERD HEARING THAT CAME UP TO HIM AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WILL NOT DO THE PEASANT SAID THEY WANT TO MAKE ME MAYOR
I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
TO MAKE HIM I CLAPPED THE GAITERS OF ONE ECCLESIASTIC ROUND THE LEGS OF ANOTHER ADDED THE SERMONS OF A THIRD AND THE CHARACTER OF A FOURTH AND SO LET HIM START ON HIS WAY IN THE BOOK TO PICK UP SUCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AS HE MIGHT FIND FOR HIMSELF
I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
ALL SORTS OF RUBBISH BROUGHT AND ADDED FROM ALL DIRECTIONS COMPLICATED THE EXTERNAL CONFUSION THE REDOUBT HAD BEEN CLEVERLY MADE OVER INTO A WALL ON THE INSIDE AND A THICKET ON THE OUTSIDE
THE BLADE BUT ANTIQUITY ADMITTED IT CAESAR THE VIOLATOR OF THE RUBICON CONFERRING AS THOUGH THEY CAME FROM HIM THE DIGNITIES WHICH EMANATED FROM THE PEOPLE NOT RISING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SENATE
THEY DIVIDED THE DAY WHICH WAS AT HAND INTO THREE DISTINCT PHASES
ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AND ON THE PANE THE QUIVERING SHADOW OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD THE AIR OF HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN WATCHING PERHAPS SHE IS THE MOTHER OF SOME ONE OF YOU
BUT YOUR FAMILIES WILL AND WHAT SUFFERINGS SEE HERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY CHILD WITH CHEEKS LIKE AN APPLE WHO BABBLES PRATTLES CHATTERS WHO LAUGHS WHO SMELLS SWEET BENEATH YOUR KISS
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD POOR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY
OLD MEN BLESSING CHILDREN THE PAST LOVING THE PRESENT THINKERS ENTIRELY AT LIBERTY BELIEVERS ON TERMS OF FULL EQUALITY FOR RELIGION HEAVEN GOD THE DIRECT PRIEST
WE ARE ADVANCING TO THE UNITY OF MAN NO MORE FICTIONS NO MORE PARASITES THE REAL GOVERNED BY THE TRUE THAT IS THE GOAL CIVILIZATION WILL HOLD ITS ASSIZES AT THE SUMMIT OF EUROPE
YOU ADOPTED HUMANITY FOR YOUR MOTHER AND RIGHT FOR YOUR FATHER YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE THAT IS TO SAY TO TRIUMPH HERE CITIZENS WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DAY THROUGH OUR DEFEAT AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR VICTORY
FROM THE EMBRACE OF ALL DESOLATIONS FAITH LEAPS FORTH SUFFERINGS BRING HITHER THEIR AGONY AND IDEAS THEIR IMMORTALITY THIS AGONY AND THIS IMMORTALITY ARE ABOUT TO JOIN
AND CONSTITUTE OUR DEATH BROTHERS HE WHO DIES HERE DIES IN THE RADIANCE OF THE FUTURE AND WE ARE ENTERING A TOMB ALL FLOODED WITH THE DAWN
ONE OF THEM WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO REMAINED WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME WAIT WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
SIX MEN WHO WERE MARCHING SEPARATELY AND AT SOME DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER ALONG THE WALL AND WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR A GRAY PATROL
HE FELT HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY THRUST ASIDE BY A PUSH IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BREAST AND A HOARSE VOICE SAID TO HIM BUT NOT LOUDLY THERE'S A DOG
WHO HAD STAYED UP TO SPREAD OUT SOME LINEN TO DRY EPONINE MADE A FINAL EFFORT WELL SAID SHE THEY'RE VERY POOR FOLKS
CRIED THENARDIER WHEN WE'VE TURNED THE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN AND PUT THE CELLAR AT THE TOP AND THE ATTIC BELOW WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT THERE IS INSIDE AND WHETHER IT'S FRANCS OR SOUS OR HALF FARTHINGS
SHE FASTENED HER INTENT GAZE UPON THENARDIER AND SAID NOT EVEN OF YOU FATHER THEN SHE CONTINUED AS SHE CAST HER BLOOD SHOT SPECTRE LIKE EYES UPON THE RUFFIANS IN TURN
WHAT DO I CARE IF I'M PICKED UP TO MORROW MORNING ON THE PAVEMENT OF THE RUE PLUMET KILLED BY THE BLOWS OF MY FATHER'S CLUB
AND HER ATTITUDE NOTHING MORE RESOLUTE AND MORE SURPRISING COULD BE SEEN THE SIX RASCALS SPEECHLESS AND GLOOMY AT BEING HELD IN CHECK BY A GIRL RETREATED BENEATH THE SHADOW CAST BY THE LANTERN AND HELD COUNSEL WITH FURIOUS AND
IT'S A SHAME TO MISS THIS ANYWAY TWO WOMEN AN OLD FELLOW WHO LODGES IN THE BACK YARD AND CURTAINS THAT AIN'T SO BAD AT THE WINDOWS THE OLD COVE MUST BE A JEW
NEAR THE FOUNTAIN OF THE ARBRE SEC THERE WERE ASSEMBLAGES MOTIONLESS AND GLOOMY GROUPS WHICH WERE TO THOSE WHO WENT AND CAME AS STONES IN THE MIDST OF RUNNING WATER AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES
AND AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN ANY STREET WHICH ONE MIGHT COME TO OFFERED NOTHING BUT DARKNESS A WILD DARKNESS FULL OF TRAPS FULL OF UNSEEN AND FORMIDABLE SHOCKS INTO WHICH IT WAS ALARMING TO PENETRATE
ALL WAS OVER NO MORE LIGHT WAS TO BE HOPED FOR HENCEFORTH EXCEPT THE LIGHTNING OF GUNS NO FURTHER ENCOUNTER EXCEPT THE ABRUPT AND RAPID APPARITION OF DEATH WHERE HOW WHEN NO ONE KNEW
WHICH HAD ALREADY WITNESSED SO MANY REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS WHILE YOUTH THE SECRET ASSOCIATIONS THE SCHOOLS IN THE NAME OF PRINCIPLES AND THE MIDDLE CLASSES IN THE NAME OF INTERESTS
HE THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER'S SWORD WHICH HIS GRANDFATHER HAD SOLD TO A SECOND HAND DEALER AND WHICH HE HAD SO MOURNFULLY REGRETTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THAT CHASTE AND VALIANT SWORD HAD DONE WELL TO ESCAPE FROM HIM
HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IF THAT SWORD WERE THERE IF AFTER TAKING POSSESSION OF IT AT HIS FATHER'S PILLOW HE HAD DARED TO TAKE IT AND CARRY IT OFF FOR THIS COMBAT OF DARKNESS BETWEEN FRENCHMEN IN THE STREETS
WHO WERE A MERE HANDFUL AGAINST AN ARMY SHOULD HE BE UNTRUE AT ONCE TO HIS LOVE TO COUNTRY TO HIS WORD SHOULD HE GIVE TO HIS COWARDICE THE PRETEXT OF PATRIOTISM BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND IF THE PHANTOM OF HIS FATHER WAS THERE IN THE GLOOM
ARE WHAT HISTORY IS IN THE HABIT OF CALLING GOOD KINGS BUT PRINCIPLES ARE NOT TO BE PARCELLED OUT THE LOGIC OF THE TRUE IS RECTILINEAR THE PECULIARITY OF TRUTH IS THAT IT LACKS COMPLAISANCE NO CONCESSIONS THEN
SOME WITH BROKEN WINDOWS AND DOORS OTHERS WITH SAGGING ROOFS AND CRUMBLING WALLS THE ONLY SIGN OF LIFE WAS IN THREE SMALL ADOBES WHERE POOR MEXICAN FAMILIES LIVED BROKEN WINDOWS IN TWO OF THE HOUSES WERE STUFFED WITH RAGS
HIS BROWN FEET RACED SO FAST THAT BY THE TIME THE GIRLS WERE DISMOUNTING BEFORE THE BIG SQUARE TWO STORIED ADOBE NEAR THE MOUNTAINS EMANUEL WAS THERE TO LEAD THEIR HORSES AROUND BACK MARY GLANCED AFFECTIONATELY AT THE OLD PLACE WITH ITS FLOWER EDGED WALK
WAS BUT IMPERFECTLY REALIZED AND THEIR TRUE RELATION TO SYLLOGISM HARDLY DREAMT OF MISTER MILL ALTERED ALL THIS HE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE GENERAL TYPE OF REASONING IS NEITHER FROM GENERALS TO PARTICULARS NOR FROM PARTICULARS TO GENERALS BUT FROM PARTICULARS TO PARTICULARS
BUT ARE NOW DEAD WE ARE ENTITLED TO CONCLUDE THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE MORTAL WE MIGHT SURELY WITHOUT ANY LOGICAL INCONSEQUENCE HAVE CONCLUDED AT ONCE FROM THOSE INSTANCES THAT THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON IS MORTAL
THIS RELIGION OF THE INFIDEL CANNOT IN HONESTY AND CONSCIENCE BE CALLED AN INTRINSICALLY BAD ONE MANY INDEED MAY BE UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS OBJECT IS CAPABLE OF GATHERING ROUND IT FEELINGS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG
WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE IDEAL TYPE OF THE MOST PERFECT POLITY FOR WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE ANY PORTION OF MANKIND ARE BETTER ADAPTED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL IMPROVEMENT AS THEY RANGE LOWER AND LOWER IN DEVELOPMENT
RATHER THAN POSITIVE OPPOSITION ARE THE OBSTACLES TO BE EXPECTED THESE HOWEVER ARE AS FATAL AND MAY BE AS HARD TO BE GOT RID OF AS ACTUAL AVERSION IT BEING EASIER IN MOST CASES TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF AN ACTIVE FEELING THAN TO CREATE ONE
AND IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC TO IT PRINCIPALLY THE HOPES AND FEARS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE DIRECTED AND BY IT BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE TERRORS AND PRESTIGE OF GOVERNMENT ARE MAINLY REPRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC EYE
OR OF SOME ONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE CONNECTED AS ADHERENTS OR DEPENDENTS THE SMALL CLASS WHO IN THIS STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING GAIN THE COMMAND OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY FOR THE MOST PART USE IT SOLELY AS A MEANS OF SEEKING THEIR FORTUNE IF THE EXECUTIVE IS WEAK
WHEN HOWEVER THE EVIL STOPS HERE THE PRICE MAY BE WORTH PAYING FOR THE PUBLICITY AND DISCUSSION WHICH THOUGH NOT AN INVARIABLE ARE A NATURAL ACCOMPANIMENT OF ANY EVEN NOMINAL REPRESENTATION
THAT THE PLACE HUNTERS WHO CHIEFLY COMPOSE THE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY THOUGH THEY CONTRIBUTE LITTLE OR NOTHING DIRECTLY TO GOOD GOVERNMENT NOR EVEN MUCH TEMPER THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE
THERE ARE OTHERS IN WHICH IT POSSIBLY MIGHT EXIST BUT IN WHICH SOME OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PREFERABLE THESE ARE PRINCIPALLY WHEN THE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO ADVANCE IN CIVILIZATION HAVE SOME LESSON TO LEARN SOME HABIT NOT YET ACQUIRED
BUT AS IT IS MERELY PERSONAL IT RARELY EFFECTS ANY CHANGE IN THE GENERAL HABITS OF THE PEOPLE UNLESS THE PROPHET LIKE MOHAMMED IS ALSO A MILITARY CHIEF AND GOES FORTH THE ARMED APOSTLE OF A NEW RELIGION
AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
SO THE THREE OF US WITH ZVERKOV FOR THE FOURTH
I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
THAT SWIMS FOREVER AGAINST THE SKY THAT MARCHES FOREVER AROUND THE HORIZON THE ROUNDED SUMMITS OF THE BLUE HILLS TO WHICH THE EYE IS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED BEFORE ENTERING THE TOWN WHICH PRINCIPALLY CLAIMS THEM ARE THE WORN DOWN STUMPS OF ANCIENT MOUNTAINS
THAT VISITORS ON ENTERING FROM THE STREET MIGHT SEE THE GLEAM OF HIS GOLD KNEE BUCKLES AS HE STOOD ON THE DISTANT PORCH THE AVENUE HOWEVER WAS NEVER COMPLETED AS BELCHER WAS APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF AND TRANSFERRED TO NEW JERSEY SHORTLY AFTER
STILL RETAINS IN ITS BROAD HOSPITABLE LINES SOME SHRED OF ITS ANCIENT CHARM MILTON IS FULL OF HISTORY FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY DAYS WHEN THE CANNONADING AT BUNKER HILL SHOOK THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HOUSES BUT NOT THE NERVES OF THE MILTON LADIES
WHEN THE FOURTH LIBERTY LOAN OF TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS SUBSCRIBED FROM A POPULATION OF NINE THOUSAND ALL THE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF PEACE AND WAR HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED ON THE HIGH LEVEL
YOU MAY SEE TOO A SOLITARY FIGURE WITH A SCIENTIST'S STOOP OR A TUTOR WITH A GROUP OF BOYS MAKING A FIRST HAND STUDY OF A REGION WHICH IS FULL OF INTEREST TO THE GEOLOGIST CIRCLING THUS AROUND THE BASE OF THE GREAT BLUE HILL
OBJECTS BOTH NEAR AND FAR BEGIN TO APPEAR AND SOON IF THE DAY IS CLEAR BUILDINGS MAY BE IDENTIFIED IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE VILLAGES WE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA ON THE HIGHEST COASTLAND
OF THE UNCANOONUC MOUNTAINS FIFTY NINE MILES AWAY THIS THEN IS THE GREAT BLUE HILL OF MILTON THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW ENGLAND CAN STAND HERE AND PICK OUT A HUNDRED DISTINGUISHING LANDMARKS
FOR A ROAD ORIGINALLY MARKED BY THE MOCCASINED FEET OF INDIANS AND WIDENED GRADUALLY BY THE TOILSOME JOURNEYINGS OF ROUGH COLONIAL CARTS AND COACHES
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH FEATURE OF THE STEADILY MOVING TRAVEL WOULD MOST FORCIBLY STRIKE THE ORIGINAL PURITAN SETTLERS OF THE TOWN THE FACT THAT EVEN THE COMMON MAN THE POOR MAN COULD OWN SUCH A VEHICLE OF SPEED AND EASE OR THE FACT THAT AMERICA
BUT A LITTLE LATER THE BELLRINGER WILL STAND ABOVE AND THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS LET INTO THE CEILING HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN THE MINISTER ENTERS THE PULPIT THE ORIGINAL BACKLESS BENCHES WERE REPLACED BY BOX PEWS WITH NARROW SEATS LIKE SHELVES

WITHOUT ADMIRING MENTION OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH THIS BUILDING OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS AND FINISH WITHIN AND WITHOUT BUILT BY BULFINCH IN EIGHTEEN O SIX IS ONE OF THE MOST FLAWLESS EXAMPLES OF ITS TYPE ON THE SOUTH SHORE
PAINTED WITH CHARMING OLD FASHIONED SKILL BY JOHN HAZLITT THE BROTHER OF THE ENGLISH ESSAYIST THE REVEREND DANIEL SHUTE HOUSE BUILT IN SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX IS PRACTICALLY INTACT WITH ITS PANELED ROOMS
WERE LANDED ON THEIR SALTY DECKS FOR FIFTY YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE RAPID SAILED AS A PACKET BETWEEN THIS TOWN AND BOSTON MAKING THE TRIP ON ONE MEMORABLE OCCASION IN SIXTY SEVEN MINUTES
THERE NEVER WAS A PROUDER MAMMA THAN MADAM CLUCK WHEN SHE LED FORTH HER FAMILY OF EIGHT DOWNY LITTLE CHICKS CHANTICLEER STRUT SNOWBALL SPECKLE PEEP PECK DOWNY AND BLOT WERE THEIR NAMES
BUT POOR MADAM CLUCK HAD BAD LUCK WITH HER CHICKS FOR THEY WERE HER FIRST AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THEM OLD AUNT COCKLETOP TOLD HER THAT SHE DIDN'T AND PREDICTED THAT THOSE POOR DEARS WOULD COME TO BAD ENDS
AUNT COCKLETOP WAS RIGHT AS YOU WILL SEE WHEN I HAVE TOLD THE SAD HISTORY OF THIS UNFORTUNATE FAMILY THE TRAGEDY BEGAN WITH CHANTY WHO WAS THE BOLDEST LITTLE COCKADOODLE WHO EVER TRIED TO CROW
SITTING SIDE BY SIDE THE PLUMP SISTERS WERE PLACIDLY SWAYING UP AND DOWN OVER THE CLEAR BROWN WATER RIPPLING BELOW WHEN AH SAD TO RELATE THE STEM BROKE AND DOWN WENT LEAF
FOR EVERY FOWL IN THE YARD TWITTED HER WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER PREACHING AND HER PRACTICE
SAID THE KIT RUBBING HER SOFT WHITE FACE AGAINST BLOT'S LITTLE BLACK BREAST
YOU'LL FALL AND GET HURT SAID HIS SISTER BLOT HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU UGLY LITTLE THING AND DON'T TALK TO ME I'M GOING TO CROW AND CAN'T BE INTERRUPTED BY ANY SILLY BIT OF A HEN BE QUIET DOWN THERE
SAM NEVER SAW HER BUT SHUT DOWN THE COVER OF THE BIN AS HE PASSED AND LEFT POOR PEEP TO DIE NO ONE KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER TILL SOME DAYS LATER WHEN SHE WAS FOUND DEAD IN THE MEAL
AND WAS INNOCENTLY CATCHING GNATS WHEN HER MAMMA CAME OUT OF THE HAY MOW WITH A LOUD CUT CUT CUT
THERE PECK STOPPED SUDDENLY ROLLED UP HER EYES AND BEGAN TO STAGGER ABOUT AS IF SHE WAS TIPSY MERCY ON US WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE CHICK CRIED MISSUS CLUCK IN GREAT ALARM FITS MA'AM ANSWERED DOCTOR DRAKE
BEING ALONE IN LONDON YET WISHING TO CELEBRATE THE DAY I DECIDED TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE LIONS AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS A LOVELY PLACE IT WAS AND I ENJOYED MYSELF IMMENSELY FOR MAY DAY IN ENGLAND IS JUST WHAT IT SHOULD BE
AND THERE FOUND A SPLENDID SIGHT SIX LIONS AND LIONESSES IN THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT CAGES SITTING OR STANDING IN DIGNIFIED ATTITUDES AND EYEING THE SPECTATORS WITH A MILD EXPRESSION IN THEIR FINE EYES
HE WAS A CROSS OLD PARTY AND SAT HUDDLED UP IN THE STRAW SCOWLING AT EVERY ONE LIKE AN ILL TEMPERED OLD BACHELOR HALF A DOZEN LITTLE ONES TEASED HIM CAPITALLY BY DROPPING BITS OF BREAD
AND BLINKED AT ME THROUGH THE GLASS LOOKING QUITE AS DANGEROUS AS HE WAS THERE WERE BIG AND LITTLE SNAKES BLACK BROWN AND SPECKLED LIVELY AND LAZY PRETTY AND PLAIN ONES BUT I LIKED THE GREAT BOA
OUT I SAID TO MYSELF THINKING OF A STORY I READ ONCE OF A PERSON IN A MENAGERIE WHO TURNED SUDDENLY AND SAW A GREAT BOA GLIDING TOWARDS HIM
AS I STOOD WONDERING IF THE BIG WORM COULD BE UNDER THE LITTLE FLAT BLANKET BEFORE ME THE BRANCH BEGAN TO MOVE ALL AT ONCE AND WITH A START I SAW A LIMB SWING DOWN TO STARE AT ME WITH THE BOA'S GLITTERING EYES
IT WAS INTENSELY DARK THE BINNACLE LAMP WAS EXTINGUISHED AND THE LIGHT IN THE CABIN BURNED TOO DIMLY TO THROW THE FAINTEST COLOUR UPON THE HATCHWAY ONE THING I QUICKLY NOTICED THAT THE GALE HAD BROKEN AND BLEW NO MORE THAN A FRESH BREEZE
THERE WAS LESS SPITE IN ITS WASH LESS FURY IN ITS BLOW THE MULTITUDINOUS ROARING OF THE HEAVING BLACKNESS HAD SOBERED INTO A HARD AND SULLEN GROWLING A SOUND AS OF THUNDER AMONG MOUNTAINS HEARD IN A VALLEY
MY LONELINESS WAS MORE TERRIBLE TO ME THAN ANY OTHER CONDITION OF MY SITUATION IT WAS DREADFUL TO BE STANDING NEARLY DEAD WITH COLD IN UTTER DARKNESS
NEVERTHELESS HER CONTINUING TO FLOAT IN HER MISERABLY TORN AND MANGLED CONDITION WAS SO GREAT A MIRACLE THAT SPITE OF MY POOR SHIPMATES HAVING PERISHED AND MY OWN STATE BEING AS HOPELESS AS THE SKY WAS STARLESS
AND EVEN HAD I MANAGED THIS SHE STOOD TO BE SWAMPED AND I TO BE DROWNED
AND HER MAIN DECK BLEW UP WITH A LOUD CLAP OR BLAST OF NOISE I COULD FOLLOW THE LINE OF HER BULWARKS FLUCTUATING AND WAVING IN THE CLEAR DARK BLUE WHEN SHE WAS SOME FEET UNDER
I HAD AT ONE TIME DURING THE BLACK HOURS STRUCK INTO A MOURNFUL CALCULATION AND RECKONED THAT THE BRIG WOULD FLOAT SOME TWO OR THREE HOURS AFTER SUNRISE
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ANOTHER TON OF WATER WOULD SINK HER AND IF THE SWELL FELL OVER HER BOWS AND FILLED THE DECKS DOWN SHE WOULD GO I HAD A SMALL PARCEL OF GUINEAS IN MY CHEST AND WAS ABOUT TO FETCH THIS MONEY
TILL ALL THAT QUARTER OF THE SEA LOOKED TO BE A MASS OF LEAPING DAZZLE UPON THE EASTERN SEA LINE LAY A RANGE OF WHITE CLOUDS COMPACT AS THE CHALK CLIFFS OF DOVER
WITH US HAD IT DAWNED YESTERDAY INSTEAD OF TO DAY MY COMPANIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIVE AND YONDER SINKING RUINED FABRIC A TRIM SHIP CAPABLE OF BEARING US STOUTLY INTO WARM SEAS AND TO OUR HOMES AT LAST
THAN BY SAILING INTO THE GREAT DESOLATION OF THE NORTH WEST THE BURDEN OF MY LONELINESS WEIGHED DOWN UPON ME SO CRUSHINGLY THAT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER MY SENSES MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DULLED BY SUFFERING
BUT ONE LIVING THING THERE WAS BESIDES MYSELF A GREY BREASTED ALBATROSS OF A PRINCELY WIDTH OF PINION I HAD NOT OBSERVED IT TILL THE HULL WENT DOWN AND THEN
LIFTING MY EYES WITH INVOLUNTARY SYMPATHY IN THE DIRECTION POINTED TO BY THE UPRAISED ARMS OF THE SAILOR I OBSERVED THE GREAT ROYAL BIRD HANGING LIKE A SHAPE OF MARBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE FROTHING EDDIES
THE CUR HAD BETRAYED HIMSELF IT WAS A PALTRY VENGEANCE I OWN TO GRATIFY A MALICIOUS PLEASURE AS I DID NOW IN THINKING OF HIM AND SPEAKING OF HIM BY THE DEGRADING NAME WHICH HIS MORBID HUMILITY HAD SUGGESTED
BUT WAS NOW INSTINCTIVELY ON HIS GUARD FOR FEAR OF BINDING HIMSELF IN ANY WAY TO ALL QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM WHETHER IMPORTANT OR QUITE TRIFLING SUCH AS WHERE WOULD HE LIVE WAS HE GOING TO REBUILD WHEN WAS HE GOING TO PETERSBURG
AND OF WHICH HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN THINKING ESPECIALLY AT THAT MOMENT IT SUFFUSED HIM SEIZED HIM AND ENVELOPED HIM COMPLETELY WHEN SHE SMILED DOUBT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IT WAS NATASHA AND HE LOVED HER
AS SOON AS HISTORIANS OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES AND TENDENCIES BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE SAME EVENT THE REPLIES THEY GIVE IMMEDIATELY LOSE ALL MEANING FOR THIS FORCE IS UNDERSTOOD BY THEM ALL NOT ONLY DIFFERENTLY BUT OFTEN IN QUITE CONTRADICTORY WAYS
SPECIALIST HISTORIANS DESCRIBING THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN OR THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS PLAINLY ASSERT THAT THESE EVENTS WERE PRODUCED BY THE WILL OF ALEXANDER BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIAN GERVINUS REFUTING THIS OPINION OF THE SPECIALIST HISTORIAN
A THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS THE SO CALLED HISTORIANS OF CULTURE FOLLOWING THE PATH LAID DOWN BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WHO SOMETIMES ACCEPT WRITERS AND LADIES AS FORCES PRODUCING EVENTS AGAIN TAKE THAT FORCE TO BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THE WHOLE PARTY APPEARED FULL OF LIFE AND CHEERFULNESS WHILE THE OLD MAN WHOM NATHAN HAD SEEN ENTER STOOD NEAR THE DOOR LOOKING QUIETLY ON WITH A LITTLE GIRL HOLDING HIS HAND
AND BEAUTIFUL AS THEY BROUGHT THEIR TASK TO A CLOSE AND THEIR FOREHEADS WITH THE HAIR BROUGHT BACK IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY TO BECOME MORE AND MORE SERENE AND HIGH THERE WAS A STRANGE BEAUTY TOO
AND FOLLOWED IN SILENCE NATHAN SPRANG UPON THE SHED AT THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH AND SCRAMBLED UP TO THE LITTLE WINDOW MISTER DUDLEY FOLLOWED AND WITH NATHAN'S HELP GAINED THE SAME PRECARIOUS FOOTHOLD LOOK IN SIR
MY FIRST TRIP UP THE RIVER WAS MADE IN THE SPRING WITH THE MISSIONARY PARTY SOON AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT WRANGELL WE LEFT WRANGELL IN THE AFTERNOON AND ANCHORED FOR THE NIGHT ABOVE THE RIVER DELTA
BUT TO HIS SURPRISE SHE FLOATED THROUGH UNDER THE ICE IN SAFETY ALL THE EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE PRESENT APPEARANCE OF THESE TWO GLACIERS INDICATES THAT THEY WERE UNITED AND FORMED A DAM ACROSS THE RIVER
WHERE IT HAS ESCAPED FIRE AND SNOW AVALANCHES THERE IS ANOTHER HANDSOME SPRUCE HEREABOUTS PICEA ALBA VERY SLENDER AND GRACEFUL IN HABIT DROOPING AT THE TOP LIKE A MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK
AND THE GLACIER WAS REACHED PERHAPS ABOUT MIDNIGHT HERE I TOOK OFF ONE OF MY BOOTS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS WRIST FOR A GOOD HOLD
I REMINDED HIM OF THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WAY HIS NERVE SHAKEN CONDITION AND ASSURED HIM I WOULD NOT BE GONE LONG BUT HE INSISTED ON TRYING
THE POOR GIRL AS I WAS STILL INCLINED TO FEAR MIGHT HAVE SERIOUS REASON TO REGRET THAT HE HAD EVER ENTERED HER FATHER'S COTTAGE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE MY STEPMOTHER AND I MET AGAIN MISSUS ROYLAKE IN AN EXQUISITE MORNING DRESS WITH HER SMILE IN PERFECT ORDER
MY STEPMOTHER WAS HER CHARMING SELF AGAIN THE MOMENT MY QUESTION HAD PASSED MY LIPS SOCIETY PROVIDED IT WAS NOT SOCIETY AT THE MILL WAS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE AS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION YOUR ABSENCE WAS THE ONLY DRAWBACK SHE ANSWERED
I MUST TELL YOU THAT LADY RACHEL IS THE ELDEST SHE IS MARRIED TO THE HONORABLE CAPTAIN MILLBAY OF THE NAVY NOW AWAY IN HIS SHIP A PERSON OF EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH OF MIND I DON'T MEAN THE CAPTAIN I MEAN LADY RACHEL
I ADMIRE HER INTELLECT BUT HER POLITICAL AND SOCIAL OPINIONS I MUST ALWAYS VIEW WITH REGRET
IN A MINUTE AFTER THE DOOR WAS OPENED FROM WITHOUT A BROWN DOG OF THE COMPANIONABLE RETRIEVER BREED RAN IN AND FAWNED UPON OLD TOLLER CRISTEL FOLLOWED FROM THE KITCHEN GARDEN WITH A BASKET OF VEGETABLES ON HER ARM
WHAT I HAD READ OF HIS WRITING DISPOSED ME NOW THAT I SAW THE MAN BY DAYLIGHT TO FIND SOMETHING DEVILISH IN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE NO STRONG AS IT WAS MY PREJUDICE FAILED TO MAKE ANY DISCOVERIES THAT PRESENTED HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE
A VISIBLE HAND TOUCHED MY ARM AS I TURNED SUDDENLY A LIVING BREATH PLAYED ON MY FACE THE CHILD HAD FADED INTO A VANISHING SHADE THE PERFECTED WOMAN WHO HAD GROWN FROM HER HAD STOLEN ON ME UNAWARES AND WAS ASKING ME TO PARDON HER
IN HIS CASE I HAD FAILED TO TRACE THE MOTIVE I TRIED TO DISCOVER IT NOW TELL ME WHY I OUGHT TO BREAK MY ENGAGEMENT I SAID REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU AT THE SPRING SHE ANSWERED
YOU ARE DECEIVED BY A FALSE FRIEND WHO LIES TO YOU AND HATES YOU THE MAN SHE WAS SPEAKING OF TURNED THE CORNER OF THE NEW COTTAGE
I WAS LEFT TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE IF I HAD BEEN TWENTY YEARS OLDER
IN WANT OF HELP I SAID WE SOMETIMES FIND IT NEARER THAN WE HAD VENTURED TO EXPECT AT OUR OWN DOORS THE ANCIENT MILLER ROSE AT THAT HINT LIKE A FISH AT A FLY GLOODY HE CRIED FIND HIM AT ONCE MISTER TOLLER
MISS CRISTEL LOOKED LIKE A PERSON SURPRISED AT SEEING A STRANGER WHAT I SHOULD CALL A FREE AND EASY STRANGER SHE WALKED IN SIR AS IF THE PLACE BELONGED TO HER I AM NOT SUSPICIOUS BY NATURE AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE
YOU SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN MISS CRISTEL HIS ANSWER RAISED HIM A STEP HIGHER IN MY ESTIMATION HOW CAN I HELP IT SIR AN ODD MAN WITH A PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAT MIGHT EXCITE A PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM IN SOME MINDS
AS AN EXCUSE TO GO TO LEAVE THE FIRING LINE I HAVE WATCHED OTHER FIGHTS WHERE THE MEN ENGAGED WERE QUITE WILLING TO UNSELFISHLY BEAR THE WOUNDED FROM THE ZONE OF DANGER
IT WAS ONLY BY THE FIRING THAT HE COULD TELL WHERE HIS MEN LAY AND THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS ADVANCING THE ADVANCES WERE MADE IN QUICK DESPERATE RUSHES SOMETIMES THE GROUND GAINED
SO EXCELLENT WAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE OFFICERS AND SO READY THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN THAT THEY KEPT AN ALMOST PERFECT ALIGNMENT AS WAS SHOWN WHEN THE FINAL ORDER CAME TO CHARGE IN THE OPEN FIELDS
WITH THE REST OF THE WOUNDED BUT TWO DAYS LATER HE APPEARED IN CAMP
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ENEMY EARLY IN THE FIGHT I CAME UPON CHURCH ATTENDING TO A YOUNG COWBOY WHO WAS SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST
WHILE TO THE ENEMY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HIS WHOLE FORCE WAS BUT THE SKIRMISH LINE IN ADVANCE OF A REGIMENT THE SPANIARDS NATURALLY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS THIN LINE WHICH SUDDENLY BROKE OUT OF THE BUSHES
WHERE HE ANNOUNCED HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ARMY ONE OF THE RESIDENTS OF SANTIAGO ASKED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IF THOSE AMERICANS FOUGHT WELL WELL HE REPLIED
AS IT WAS OWING TO COLONEL WOOD'S CHARGE WHICH TOOK THE SPANIARDS IN FLANK THAT GENERAL WHEELER AND GENERAL YOUNG WERE ABLE TO ADVANCE
I KNEW IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AND YET HE WAS CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER TIME OF EXCITEMENT AND RUSH AND HEAT THEN I REMEMBERED HIM AS NOW HE HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BLOOD AND DIRT AND PERSPIRATION
HAD BEEN ABANDONED ALL ALONG ITS LENGTH IT LOOKED AS THOUGH A RETREATING ARMY HAD FLED ALONG IT RATHER THAN THAT ONE TROOP HAD FOUGHT ITS WAY THROUGH IT TO THE FRONT
SOME PLACE WHERE THERE IS SHADE AND A BREEZE
IT GAVE ONE A THRILL OF AWE AND WONDER TO SEE HOW THESE COWBOY SURGEONS WITH A STICK THAT ONE WOULD USE TO LIGHT A PIPE AND WITH THE GAUDY KERCHIEFS THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THEIR NECKS
WHICH THEY IMAGINED MUST HAVE SWUNG TO THE RIGHT AND HAVING LOST ITS BEARINGS AND HEARING THEM ADVANCING THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH HAD MISTAKEN THEM FOR THE ENEMY THEY ACCORDINGLY CEASED FIRING AND BEGAN SHOUTING
ALL THE FREEMEN IN THE WEST OF ICELAND HAD COME TO A MEETING HERE THEY MADE LAWS AND PUNISHED MEN FOR HAVING DONE WRONG THE MEETING WAS OVER NOW MEN WERE WALKING ABOUT THE PLAIN AND TALKING EVERYBODY SEEMED MUCH EXCITED
A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP THAT SHOOK THE RAFTERS THEN THE MEN SAT AND TALKED OVER PLANS WHILE THEY SAT A STRANGER CAME INTO THE HALL I HAVE NO TIME TO DRINK HE SAID
WE SHALL SURELY FIND SOMETHING I DO NOT KNOW EITHER HOW LONG WE MUST GO SO THEY SAILED THAT STRANGE OCEAN NEVER DREAMING WHAT MIGHT BE AHEAD OF THEM THEY FOUND NO ISLANDS TO REST ON THEY MET HEAVY FOGS
IT MUST BE GIANTS THAT SAIL IN IT FROST GIANTS SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN BUT AS THEY CAME NEARER
WHAT WILL IT BE IN WINTER WE MUST FIND A PLACE TO BUILD A HOUSE NOW BEFORE THE WINTER COMES ON SAID ERIC WE MUST NOT FREEZE HERE SO THEY CHOSE A LITTLE SPOT WITH HILLS ABOUT IT TO KEEP OFF THE WIND
IS DRY FOR MEAD THIS IS A BARE AND COLD AND HUNGRY LAND I WILL VISIT MY FRIENDS IN ICELAND AND OUR SWORDS ARE RUSTY WITH LONG RESTING SAID HIS MEN PERHAPS WE CAN FIND PLAY FOR THEM IN ICELAND
SOME MEN WENT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT FROLIC TO GO TO A NEW COUNTRY SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY WERE POOR IN ICELAND AND THOUGHT I CAN BE NO WORSE OFF IN GREENLAND AND PERHAPS I SHALL GROW RICH THERE AND SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY LOVED ERIC
OTHER MEN GREW HEARTSICK AT THE TERRIBLE STORM AND THE LONG VOYAGE AND NO SIGHT OF LAND AND THEY TURNED BACK TO ICELAND SO OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE SHIPS ONLY FIFTEEN GOT TO GREENLAND
SO HE HELPED LEIF FIT OUT A BOAT AND SENT HIM OFF LEIF SAILED FOR MONTHS HE PASSED ICELAND AND THE FAROES AND THE SHETLANDS HE STOPPED AT ALL OF THESE PLACES AND FEASTED HIS MIND ON THE NEW THINGS
IT WAS SUCH A FEAST AS HAD NOT BEEN IN ICELAND FOR YEARS THORBIORN SPENT ON IT ALL THE WEALTH THAT HE HAD LEFT FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT LEAVE IN SHAME MEN SHALL REMEMBER MY LAST FEAST
POLLY WAS ALREADY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF HOLDING UP AN IMAGINARY APRON AND AT LAST THE LITTLE GIRL UNDERSTOOD BY GESTURES WHAT SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET INTO HER HEAD BY WORDS SO SHE PICKED UP THE SKIRT OF HER GOWN IN HER STURDY LITTLE FISTS
AND DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN AND THE HAND WAS WITHDRAWN AND THE GIRL CLATTERED OFF AS FAST AS SHE COULD RUN IN HER WOODEN SHOES I GOT THEM SAID POLLY RUNNING BACK IN TRIUMPH TO JASPER
AND THE REST OF THE PARTY CROWDED UP AS CLOSE AS THEY COULD THEY ARE HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING CLOTHES SAID MISSUS FISHER I DO BELIEVE FOR THE OLD WOMAN WAS WORKING FEARFULLY HARD TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND
BUT WITH A SMART ENERGETIC WAY MISTER BAXTER APPROVED OF HER HE LIKED HER STYLE AS HE WOULD HAVE SAID THE SUMMER TERM HAD JUST OPENED IN THE MAITLAND DISTRICT ESTHER MAXWELL WAS A STRANGER
WHEN I SEND MY BOYS TO SCHOOL I NATURALLY EXPECT THAT THE TEACHER WILL BE CAPABLE OF DOING THE WORK SHE HAS BEEN HIRED TO DO THEN YOU REFUSE TO HELP ME SAID ESTHER IN A TREMBLING VOICE
I NEVER KNEW ISAAC CROPPER TO CHANGE HIS OPINIONS SO HANDSOMELY ESTHER SMILED
TIS ONE OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH A MAN HAD BETTER DO OVER AGAIN THAN DISPUTE ABOUT IT THAT WHATEVER TOWN OR FORTRESS THE CORPORAL WAS AT WORK UPON DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN MY UNCLE TOBY ALWAYS TOOK CARE ON THE INSIDE OF HIS SENTRY BOX
MISSUS WADMAN HAD IT EVER TO TAKE UP OR WITH THE GENTLEST PUSHINGS PROTRUSIONS AND EQUIVOCAL COMPRESSIONS THAT A HAND TO BE REMOVED IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING TO GET IT PRESS'D A HAIR BREADTH OF ONE SIDE OUT OF HER WAY
YOU WILL READILY CONCEIVE TO BE OF DIFFERENT KINDS VARYING FROM EACH OTHER LIKE THE ATTACKS WHICH HISTORY IS FULL OF AND FROM THE SAME REASONS A GENERAL LOOKER ON WOULD SCARCE ALLOW THEM TO BE ATTACKS AT ALL OR IF HE DID WOULD CONFOUND THEM ALL TOGETHER BUT I WRITE NOT TO THEM
ALWAYS EXCEPTING WHEN I AM WRITING UPON THESE MATTERS THE PRICKS WHICH ENTERED THE FLESH OF SAINT RADAGUNDA IN THE DESERT WHICH IN YOUR ROAD FROM FESSE TO CLUNY THE NUNS OF THAT NAME WILL SHEW YOU FOR LOVE
WHERE HE BROKE IN UPON THE ENEMY'S WORKS FORCED HIS PASSAGE OVER THE DANUBE CROSS'D THE LECH PUSH'D ON HIS TROOPS INTO THE HEART OF THE EMPIRE
BECAUSE IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE DON PEDRO THE BISHOP OF LEON HOW CAME PRIESTS AND BISHOPS AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO TROUBLE THEIR HEADS SO MUCH ABOUT GUN POWDER GOD KNOWS SAID MY UNCLE TOBY
OF THE CORPORAL THAT HE DISCONTINUED HIS DISSERTATION UPON GUN POWDER AND BEGGED THE CORPORAL FORTHWITH TO GO ON WITH HIS STORY OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA AND HIS SEVEN CASTLES
FORTHWITH BEGAN TO RUN BACK IN HIS MIND THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS IN THE KING OF BOHEMIA'S STORY FROM EVERY ONE OF WHICH IT APPEARING THAT HE WAS THE MOST FORTUNATE MAN THAT EVER EXISTED IN THE WORLD IT PUT THE CORPORAL TO A STAND FOR NOT CARING TO RETRACT HIS EPITHET
THAT EVERY BALL HAD ITS BILLET HE WAS A GREAT MAN SAID MY UNCLE TOBY AND I BELIEVE CONTINUED TRIM TO THIS DAY THAT THE SHOT WHICH DISABLED ME AT THE BATTLE OF LANDEN WAS POINTED AT MY KNEE FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE BUT TO TAKE ME OUT OF HIS SERVICE AND PLACE ME IN YOUR HONOUR'S
IT'S HIGH TIME I SHOULD SAID MY UNCLE TOBY YOUR HONOUR REMEMBERS WITH CONCERN SAID THE CORPORAL THE TOTAL ROUT AND CONFUSION OF OUR CAMP AND ARMY AT THE AFFAIR OF LANDEN EVERY ONE WAS LEFT TO SHIFT FOR HIMSELF
EXCEPT THE GROIN SAID MY UNCLE TOBY AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL THE KNEE IN MY OPINION
FROM TEARING THE VERY FLESH OFF YOUR BONES IN CONTESTATION WHETHER THAT YEAR IS NOT ALWAYS THE LAST CAST YEAR OF THE LAST CAST ALMANACK' I TELL YOU PLAINLY IT WAS BUT FROM A DIFFERENT REASON THAN YOU WOT OF IT WAS THE YEAR NEXT HIM
UNDER HER GREAT DETERMINATION TO KEEP GWENDOLEN IN HER OWN CARE BUT WITH JUPP TO WATCH THE DOCK AND A MAN IN PLAIN CLOTHES AT THE DOOR OF THE SMALL HOTEL SHE WAS AT PRESENT BOUND FOR I THOUGHT I MIGHT REMAIN IN YONKERS CONTENTEDLY THE WHOLE DAY
BUT WITH NO EASE TO HERSELF FOR SHE WAS NOT EVEN LEANING AGAINST ITS BACK
I ALSO KNEW THAT THIS PATIENT HAD OVERHEARD WHAT YOU SAID AS WELL AS I FOR IMPERVIOUS AS THE DOOR LOOKED I HAD OFTEN HEARD THE DOCTOR'S MUTTERINGS WHEN HE THOUGHT I WAS SAFE BEYOND EAR SHOT IF NOT ASLEEP
WAS SHE OF COMMON BLOOD COMMON MANNERS IT DOES NOT SEEM POSSIBLE GWENDOLEN IS BY NATURE SO DAINTY IN ALL HER WAYS THE WOMAN WAS A LADY I DID NOT SEE HER FACE IT WAS HEAVILY VEILED
BUT I HEARD HER VOICE IT WAS A LADY'S VOICE AND WHAT SHE WORE BEAUTIFUL JEWELS JEWELS YOU SAID SHE WAS POOR SO SHE DECLARED HERSELF BUT SHE HAD ON HER NECK UNDER HER COAT
TO COUNT CORRECTLY SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD THEM ALL BUT THIS HAS BEEN IN MY POCKET FOR SIX YEARS PERHAPS YOU HAVE SEEN ITS LIKE
WITH PLEASURE MADAM AND THUS WAS THAT TERRIFYING APATHY BROKEN UP
IF SHE COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT ME I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT HER I'M THE EASIEST GOING PERSON IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ALLOWING THE GIRL YOU ARE PRACTICALLY ENGAGED TO TO MAKE A FOOL OF HERSELF OVER ANOTHER MAN I WON'T STAND FOR IT
AH BRUNG HIM SOME SOUP BUT HE GOT UP POWFUL SUDDEN LAK HE HAD A CALL TO DE TELEPHOME AN HE AIN'T COME BACK ARE YOU SURE OF THAT GEORGE YAS SUH
BUT NOW THEY COULD TELL THE WHOLE WORLD FOR JESUS WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THEY WERE GLAD THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE QUIET ANY LONGER
THIS TIME HE CARRIED A WHIP IN THE COURT OF THE GENTILES THE MONEY WAS CLINKING AS IT HAD DONE WHEN JESUS WAS A BOY AT TABLES SAT THE MEN WHO GREW RICH BY EXCHANGING THE MONEY OF VISITORS FOR COINS USED IN JERUSALEM
NEITHER AM I GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT I HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS EVERY DAY THAT WEEK JESUS CAME AND TAUGHT IN THE TEMPLE SEVERAL TIMES HIS ENEMIES TRIED TO TRICK HIM INTO SAYING SOMETHING THAT WOULD TURN THE PEOPLE AGAINST HIM
NOR DO WE ONLY KNOW ENEMIES IN PICTURES BUT IN THEIR OWN REAL SHAPES AND AT ALL RISKS AND ON ALL OCCASIONS WE ATTACK THEM WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO CHILDISH POINTS OR RULES OF SINGLE COMBAT WHETHER ONE HAS OR HAS NOT A SHORTER LANCE OR SWORD
BUT SOME THERE ARE THAT MIGHT HAVE HEARD THEE AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WELL FOR THEE IN THAT CASE FOR THEY ARE NOT ALL COURTEOUS OR MANNERLY SOME ARE ILL CONDITIONED SCOUNDRELS NOR IS IT EVERYONE THAT CALLS HIMSELF A GENTLEMAN THAT IS SO IN ALL RESPECTS SOME ARE GOLD OTHERS PINCHBECK
MAY GOD ALMIGHTY IN HIS INFINITE POWER GRANT THAT ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHO WOULD IMPEDE OR HINDER THY THIRD SALLY MAY FIND NO WAY OUT OF THE LABYRINTH OF THEIR SCHEMES NOR EVER ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY MOST DESIRE AND THEN TURNING TO THE HOUSEKEEPER HE SAID
FOR EXAMPLES OF THE SECOND SORT OF LINEAGE THAT BEGAN WITH GREATNESS AND MAINTAINS IT STILL WITHOUT ADDING TO IT
EVEN THOUGH HE KNOW HIM NOT WILL FAIL TO RECOGNISE AND SET HIM DOWN AS ONE OF GOOD BLOOD AND IT WOULD BE STRANGE WERE IT NOT SO PRAISE HAS EVER BEEN THE REWARD OF VIRTUE AND THOSE WHO ARE VIRTUOUS CANNOT FAIL TO RECEIVE COMMENDATION
AT THIS MOMENT THERE CAME A KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
SO THAT TO BRING HIM ROUND AGAIN EVER SO LITTLE COST ME MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED EGGS
SAMSON'S INTENTION IN PERSUADING HIM TO SALLY FORTH ONCE MORE WAS TO DO WHAT THE HISTORY RELATES FARTHER ON
OF THE HONOUR OF VIRGINS OF THE AID OF WIDOWS AND OF THE SUPPORT OF WIVES AND OTHER MATTERS OF THIS KIND APPERTAINING BELONGING PROPER AND PECULIAR
MADE THEM AN OFFER OF HIS COMPANY AND BEGGED THEM TO SLACKEN THEIR PACE AS THEIR YOUNG ASSES TRAVELLED FASTER THAN HIS HORSE AND THEN TO GRATIFY THEM HE TOLD THEM IN A FEW WORDS WHO HE WAS AND THE CALLING AND PROFESSION HE FOLLOWED
NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THEE BUT JUDAS HIMSELF AND I WISH HE HAD THEE TELL ME THOU ANIMAL WHAT DOST THOU KNOW ABOUT NAILS OR WHEELS OR ANYTHING ELSE OH IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME REPLIED SANCHO IT IS NO WONDER MY WORDS ARE TAKEN FOR NONSENSE
THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MAJALAHONDA I SAY OF DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE NOT SO AND DISCRIMINATION IS THE GRAMMAR OF GOOD LANGUAGE IF IT BE ACCOMPANIED BY PRACTICE I SIRS FOR MY SINS HAVE STUDIED CANON LAW AT SALAMANCA
IT GREW DARK BUT BEFORE THEY REACHED THE TOWN IT SEEMED TO THEM ALL AS IF THERE WAS A HEAVEN FULL OF COUNTLESS GLITTERING STARS IN FRONT OF IT THEY HEARD TOO THE PLEASANT MINGLED NOTES OF A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS FLUTES DRUMS
SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND CALLED TO HIS SQUIRE SANCHO WHO WAS STILL SNORING
LET HIM DO WHAT HE LIKES RETURNED SANCHO BE HE NOT POOR HE WOULD MARRY QUITERIA TO MAKE A GRAND MATCH FOR HIMSELF AND HE WITHOUT A FARTHING IS THERE NOTHING ELSE FAITH
BUT WHEN SUCH GIFTS FALL TO ONE THAT HAS HARD CASH I WISH MY CONDITION OF LIFE WAS AS BECOMING AS THEY ARE
AND EVEN IF IT WERE SO I DESIRE YOU TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND COME ALONG FOR THE INSTRUMENTS WE HEARD LAST NIGHT ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO ENLIVEN THE VALLEYS AGAIN AND NO DOUBT THE MARRIAGE WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING AND NOT IN THE HEAT OF THE AFTERNOON
AND SIX STEWPOTS THAT STOOD ROUND THE BLAZE HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN THE ORDINARY MOULD OF COMMON POTS FOR THEY WERE SIX HALF WINE JARS EACH FIT TO HOLD THE CONTENTS OF A SLAUGHTER HOUSE
CONTEMPLATED ALL AND EVERYTHING WON HIS HEART THE FIRST TO CAPTIVATE AND TAKE HIS FANCY WERE THE POTS
AT LAST WHEN DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO COME THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES OVERHEAD THEY HEARD QUEEN ERMINTRUDE SAYING IN A VERY TIRED VOICE THAT IT WAS NO USE LOOKING ANY MORE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND GET SOME SLEEP
BECAUSE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED A TITLE THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND A STATION THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND HAD LEFT HIS COUNTRY HE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE WORD EMIGRANT IN THE PRESENT ACCEPTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL WAS IN USE
NO AND THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO QUIET THEM WHICH IT DID NOT FOR THEY CONTINUED TO CRY NO
SO FAR FROM BEING IN FAVOUR WITH THE ARISTOCRAT GOVERNMENT THERE HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BY IT AS THE FOE OF ENGLAND AND FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AS HE BROUGHT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO VIEW WITH THE GREATEST DISCRETION
FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
PUT IN A BULLET ABOVE THE SMALL SHOT AND BRUSHING AWAY THE MOSQUITOES WITH THE WIDE SLEEVE OF HIS CIRCASSIAN COAT HE WENT SLOWLY TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP BACK THE DOG
HE EVEN FELT THAT WITHOUT THIS MOSQUITO FILLED ATMOSPHERE AROUND HIM AND THAT MOSQUITO PASTE MINGLED WITH PERSPIRATION WHICH HIS HAND SMEARED OVER HIS FACE AND THAT UNCEASING IRRITATION ALL OVER HIS BODY
AND DID NOT THINK OF OR WISH FOR ANYTHING
IT FOLLOWS THAT IT IS THESE DESIRES THAT ARE ILLEGITIMATE BUT NOT THE NEED FOR HAPPINESS BUT WHAT DESIRES CAN ALWAYS BE SATISFIED DESPITE EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT ARE THEY LOVE SELF SACRIFICE

JUNO RESOLVES HERSELF INTO ARAMINTA A PRETENSION TO DIVINITY NOT ADMITTED CREATES AFFECTATION IN DEFAULT OF THUNDERCLAPS THERE IS IMPERTINENCE THE TEMPLE SHRIVELS INTO THE BOUDOIR NOT HAVING THE POWER TO BE A GODDESS SHE IS AN IDOL

ALTHOUGH THE ENGLAND OF THE PERIOD QUARRELS AND FIGHTS FRANCE SHE IMITATES HER AND DRAWS ENLIGHTENMENT FROM HER AND THE LIGHT ON THE FACADE OF ENGLAND IS FRENCH LIGHT IT IS A PITY THAT ANNE'S REIGN LASTED BUT TWELVE YEARS OR THE ENGLISH WOULD NOT HESITATE TO CALL IT THE CENTURY OF ANNE
NOT FROM CHOICE HOWEVER A PART OF HER RELIGION SHE DERIVED FROM THAT UGLINESS
ANNE HAVING THIS INFERIOR BLOOD IN HER VEINS FELT HERSELF BUT HALF ROYAL AND JOSIANA HAVING COME INTO THE WORLD QUITE IRREGULARLY DREW CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE INCORRECTNESS LESS GREAT BUT REALLY EXISTING IN THE BIRTH OF THE QUEEN
IT IS A SORT OF MORAL LAZINESS MASQUERADING AS AFFECTION STILL I SUPPOSE CUSTOM AND TRADITION KEPT THIS GIRL IN HER PLACE AND SHE WAS PETTED HONOURED AMUSED
HARSH EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND VERY PROFOUND MENTAL DISTURBANCE THERE HAVE BEEN LOVE EXPERIENCES EXPERIENCES THAT WERE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE TREATS AND ATTENTIONS AND PROPOSALS THAT MADE UP HER LIFE WHEN SHE WAS SHELTERED OVER THERE
I SEE A LOT MORE THAN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IT IS TO BE AS I AM RATHER COLD AND UNRESPONSIVE TO WOMEN AND UNATTRACTIVE AND NEGLIGIBLE NEGLIGIBLE THAT IS THE EXACT WORD TO THEM YOU CAN'T LOOK AT A WOMAN FOR FIVE MINUTES
GROTESQUELY HAPPEN HE SAID SHE KNOWS NOTHING OF MARTIN LEEDS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT AND THEN HE ADDED IF SHE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE

IT'S REFRESHING TO MEET YOU I FOUND IT REFRESHING TO MEET MARTINEAU A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT DOCTOR MARTINEAU TURNED SIR RICHMOND INTO A NEW CHANNEL HE'S A MOST INTERESTING MAN HE SAID RATHER SHY IN SOME RESPECTS
WALLS ANIMALS AND FIRE IN A MIST OF DARKNESS AND FOLDING ALSO ABOUT HIS OWN MIND OTHER FORMS MOVED SILENTLY ACROSS THE FIELD OF VISION FORMS THAT HE RECOGNISED FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS AND WELCOMED NOT
AND POWER AND CONFIDENCE CAME WITH THEM HE BEGAN TO BREATHE DEEPLY AND REGULARLY AND AT THE SAME TIME TO ABSORB INTO HIMSELF THE FORCES OPPOSED TO HIM AND TO TURN THEM TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT
BY CEASING TO RESIST AND ALLOWING THE DEADLY STREAM TO POUR INTO HIM UNOPPOSED HE USED THE VERY POWER SUPPLIED BY HIS ADVERSARY AND THUS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED HIS OWN FOR THIS SPIRITUAL ALCHEMY HE HAD LEARNED HE UNDERSTOOD THAT FORCE
NOTING THE LINE OF BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS THAT FOLLOWED THE MOTION OF HIS HAND DOWN ITS BACK AND THEN THEY ADVANCED TOGETHER TOWARDS THE CORNER WHERE THE DOG WAS SMOKE WENT FIRST AND PUT HIS NOSE GENTLY AGAINST HIS FRIEND'S MUZZLE PURRING WHILE HE RUBBED
AND WOULD NOT GIVE FORTH A CHEERFUL FLAME
SAT ON HIS STONE TO LISTEN NEVER YET HAD SUCH SWEET STRAINS BEEN HEARD IN THE WORLD OF GLOOM THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME TEARS MOISTENED THE CHEEKS OF THE FURIES AND EVEN THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE DEAD WERE MOVED TO PITY
IT CRIED TILL HEAD AND LYRE WERE CARRIED DOWN TO THE SEA AND ON TO LESBOS THE ISLE OF SWEET SONG WHERE IN AFTER YEARS
ALI AND NARI CAME TO LIVE WITH HIM SIGUNA WAS A KIND WOMAN FAR TOO GOOD AND KIND FOR LOKI SHE FELT SORRY FOR HIM NOW THAT SHE SAW HE WAS IN GREAT FEAR AND THAT EVERY LIVING THING HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM
AND HID HIMSELF BETWEEN TWO STONES THE GODS ENTERED THE HOUSE AND LOOKED ALL ROUND IN VAIN FOR LOKI
BE ABLE TO TORMENT THE INHABITANTS OF MANHEIM OR ASGARD BY HIS EVIL DOINGS THOR PROPOSED TO RETURN TO ASGARD TO BRING A CHAIN WITH WHICH TO BIND THE PRISONER BUT ODIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD NO NEED TO TAKE SUCH A JOURNEY
LOKI HE SAID HAS ALREADY FORGED FOR HIMSELF A CHAIN STRONGER THAN ANY YOU CAN MAKE WHILE WE HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN CATCHING HIM HIS TWO SONS ALI AND NARI TRANSFORMED INTO WOLVES
WITH A HIGHWAYMAN ON A MOONLIT HEATH AND BUSKIRK'S GIRL WHO JOINED THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF TEMPERANCE JUST TO SEE WHAT WAS INTO IT AND IN EACH IMPERSONATION SHE WAS SO THOROUGHLY THE THING IMPERSONATED
VERY FEW CATS HAVE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE SUCH AN INORDINATE APPETITE FOR FLATTERY THAT THEY WILL SWALLOW ANY AMOUNT OF IT AND THRIVE THEREON PADDY HAD A FINER TASTE THE STORY GIRL AND I WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD PAY HIM COMPLIMENTS TO HIS LIKING
A PRETTY WALK THROUGH A WORLD OF GREEN WHISPERING BOUGHS AND SPICE SWEET FERNS AND SHIFTING PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RASPBERRIES WERE PLENTIFUL
I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE'D LAUGH ONCE AND HAVE IT DONE WITH IT
AS YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR BREAKFAST
I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
MY DEAR YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN WAS MISSUS ALLEN'S REPLY HER ASSURANCE HOWEVER STANDING SOLE AS IT DID WAS NOT THROWN AWAY IT BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
OR AT LEAST OF ITS APPEARANCE AND WAS ONLY EAGER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING ITS CAUSE THE PLAY CONCLUDED THE CURTAIN FELL HENRY TILNEY WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO SAT BUT HIS FATHER REMAINED
AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
ERECTED IN AN AMPHITHEATRICAL MANNER AND RICHLY EMBELLISH'D SOME FEW LEAGUES FROM THE CITY THITHER THE COMBATANTS OR CHAMPIONS WERE TO REPAIR COMPLEATLY ACCOUTRED EACH OF THEM HAD A DISTINCT APARTMENT TO HIMSELF BEHIND THE LISTS
SHE SENT HIM LIKEWISE ONE OF THE FINEST HORSES IN ALL PERSIA
HIS ARMOUR WAS MADE OF PURE GOLD ENAMELL'D WITH GREEN THE HOUSINGS OF HIS SADDLE WERE GREEN AND HIS LANCE EMBELLISH'D WITH GREEN RIBBANDS EVERY ONE WAS SENSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT
WITH LOUD ACCLAMATIONS CRIED OUT VICTORY VICTORY IN FAVOUR OF THE CHAMPION IN WHITE
HE COULD NEVER RECOVER THE WHITE ARMOUR AGAIN WHICH SHE HAD SENT HIM THAT WAS THE COMPROMISE OR THE ENGAGEMENT TO WHICH THE COMBATANTS HAD ALL UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THUS AS HE WAS ON THE ONE HAND PLUNG'D IN AN ABYSS OF SORROW
AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE WHEN NOT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THEM RESTORED ELIZABETH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HER FORMER DISLIKE THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY
WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM
SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA
AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED
WHATEVER BEARS AFFINITY TO CUNNING IS DESPICABLE MISS BINGLEY WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY AS TO CONTINUE THE SUBJECT
AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
AND NEVER OPEN THEIR MOUTHS QUITE MISTAKE THE MATTER DID CHARLOTTE DINE WITH YOU NO SHE WOULD GO HOME I FANCY SHE WAS WANTED ABOUT THE MINCE PIES
AND A SORT OF NATURAL SELF CONSEQUENCE WHICH THE ATTENTION OF THE OFFICERS TO WHOM HER UNCLE'S GOOD DINNERS AND HER OWN EASY MANNERS RECOMMENDED HER HAD INCREASED INTO ASSURANCE
BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE DANCING WHEN SHE IS ILL LYDIA DECLARED HERSELF SATISFIED
AND BY THAT TIME MOST LIKELY CAPTAIN CARTER WOULD BE AT MERYTON AGAIN AND WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR BALL SHE ADDED I SHALL INSIST ON THEIR GIVING ONE ALSO I SHALL TELL COLONEL FORSTER IT WILL BE QUITE A SHAME IF HE DOES NOT
IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
COMPOSE THE SEASON FOR ENJOYMENT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY HAVE THEIR STORMS BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT AND NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE AND A CLOUDLESS SKY
HAD PLEASANTLY INSISTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF HER NEPHEW SHOULD IN NO MANNER INTERFERE WITH THE REGULAR HOURS SHE HAD ESTABLISHED CONSEQUENTLY THE PARTY WERE ALREADY SEATED WHEN THE CAPTAIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE
RUN REPEATED THE BRITISH OFFICER GATHERING HIMSELF UP IN MILITARY PRIDE NO MISTER CAESAR RUNNING IS NOT MY TRADE WHILE SPEAKING HE WALKED DELIBERATELY TO THE WINDOW
THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS HASTILY AND IMPERFECTLY COMPLETED AS THE DRAGOONS ENTERED THE LAWN AND ORCHARD OF THE LOCUSTS RIDING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THE WIND AND IN THEIR TURN THE WHARTONS WERE SURROUNDED
MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE CLOUD STIRRING NORTH ARISE THE STREAKED BLUE APPEAR AND SOON AN OPENING MADE IN THE VAPOURS IN THE EYE OF THE WIND THROUGH WHICH THE BRIGHT AZURE SHINES
CAN IT BE TRUE EACH ASKED THE OTHER WITH WONDER AND DISMAY THAT WHOLE COUNTRIES ARE LAID WASTE WHOLE NATIONS ANNIHILATED BY THESE DISORDERS IN NATURE THE VAST CITIES OF AMERICA THE FERTILE PLAINS OF
WE CALLED TO MIND THE PLAGUE OF THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN IT WAS CALCULATED THAT A THIRD OF MANKIND HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS YET WESTERN EUROPE WAS UNINFECTED WOULD IT ALWAYS BE SO
PLAGUE DIES WITH HIM UNCOMMUNICATED AND INNOXIOUS LET US WEEP FOR OUR BRETHREN THOUGH WE CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE THEIR REVERSE
EVEN THE SOURCE OF COLONIES WAS DRIED UP FOR IN NEW HOLLAND
THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH VESSELS WITH EMIGRANTS THE TOTAL CESSATION OF COMMERCE THE STARVING MULTITUDE THAT THRONGED AROUND THE PALACE OF THE PROTECTORATE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH
AND NOT FEAR ITS GROWTH AND MATURITY THUS WE BEGAN TO FEEL WITH REGARD TO MANY VISAGED DEATH LET LOOSE ON THE CHOSEN DISTRICTS OF OUR FAIR HABITATION
IN THE SAME WAY INDIVIDUALS MAY ESCAPE NINETY NINE TIMES AND RECEIVE THE DEATH BLOW AT THE HUNDREDTH BECAUSE BODIES ARE SOMETIMES
A BREATHLESS SENTIMENT OF WONDER A PAINFUL SENSE
YET TO THE HONOUR OF THE ENGLISH BE IT RECORDED THAT ALTHOUGH NATURAL
SO FAR AS TO MAKE A REACTION DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO PESTILENCE WOULD CEASE IT WERE WELL THAT IN THE MEAN TIME
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED OUR FINE BREEDS OF HORSES OR HAVE UTTERLY CHANGED THE FACE OF THE ORNAMENTED PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
VISITATION WE BREATHED AGAIN
BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE DISMAL SOUNDS SO SOON AFTER MY POOR LADY'S DEATH TOO
AND FINE TRIMMINGS BODED NO GOOD I GUESSED WHAT THEY WERE GOOD GOD EXCLAIMED EMILY WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME
IF YOU ARE TO GO RUNNING ABOUT THE CASTLE AMONG ALL THESE DRUNKEN SIGNORS
COME FORTH MY VALOROUS SIGNOR STEWARD JUST THEN OLD CARLO OPENED HIS DOOR AND HE CAME WITH A FLASK IN HIS HAND FOR AS SOON AS THE SIGNOR SAW HIM
BECAUSE SAID HE WE DON'T GO SHARES THERE THIS INFORMATION HEIGHTENED EMILY'S IMPATIENCE TO KNOW MORE AND ANNETTE IMMEDIATELY DEPARTED ON HER ENQUIRY THE LATE RESOLUTION OF EMILY TO RESIGN HER ESTATES TO MONTONI NOW GAVE WAY TO NEW CONSIDERATIONS
ALL THE WORLD COULD NOT PERSUADE ME OUT OF THEM ROBERTO AND SEBASTIAN AND HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THEM WENT INTO FITS TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT I SAID MYSELF THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT
WERE THE SAME OR IF THEY WERE WHETHER THIS WAS VALANCOURT SHE HOWEVER DESIRED THAT ANNETTE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO LEARN WHETHER ANY PRISONERS WERE IN THE CASTLE AND ALSO THEIR NAMES O DEAR MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I FORGET TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU BADE ME ASK ABOUT
AND A WATCH CHAIN OF SOLID GOLD WHICH HELD A CHARM OF RICH DESIGN AND A WATCH OF THE LATEST MAKE AND ENGRAVING HE KNEW BY NAME AND COULD GREET PERSONALLY WITH A WELL OLD FELLOW
BARELY COMES DOWN TO THE OFFICE NOW JUST ONE BOY HASN'T HE ASKED HURSTWOOD YES AND A SWIFT PACER LAUGHED DROUET I
AND WAS GLAD NOT ONLY TO MEET HIM BUT TO VISIT THE ADAMS STREET BAR THEREAFTER WHENEVER HE WANTED A DRINK OR A CIGAR HURSTWOOD WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER AFTER HIS KIND HE WAS SHREWD AND CLEVER IN MANY LITTLE THINGS
TO ONE NOT INCLINED TO DRINK AND GIFTED WITH A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MIND SUCH A BUBBLING CHATTERING GLITTERING CHAMBER MUST EVER SEEM AN ANOMALY A STRANGE COMMENTARY ON NATURE AND LIFE
THE DRESSY GREEDY COMPANY THE SMALL SELF INTERESTED PALAVER THE DISORGANIZED AIMLESS WANDERING MENTAL ACTION WHICH IT REPRESENTS THE LOVE OF LIGHT AND SHOW AND FINERY WHICH TO ONE OUTSIDE
UNDER THE SERENE LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL STARS MUST SEEM A STRANGE AND SHINY THING UNDER THE STARS AND SWEEPING NIGHT WINDS WHAT A LAMP FLOWER IT MUST BLOOM A
SAID DROUET MENTIONING THE POPULAR FARCE OF THE TIME WELL YOU'D BETTER BE GOING IT'S HALF AFTER EIGHT ALREADY AND HE DREW OUT HIS WATCH THE CROWD WAS ALREADY THINNING OUT CONSIDERABLY
THE LATTER'S GENIAL NATURE AND DRESSY APPEARANCE PLEASED HIM HE KNEW THAT DROUET WAS ONLY A TRAVELLING SALESMAN AND NOT ONE OF MANY YEARS AT THAT BUT THE FIRM OF BARTLETT CARYOE AND COMPANY
AND ON THE OTHER AS WELL LITTLE JOHN KNEW TO THE MERRY BLUE BOAR INN HERE LITTLE JOHN SUDDENLY CEASED WHISTLING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH FIRST HE LOOKED UP AND THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND THEN TILTING HIS CAP OVER ONE EYE HE SLOWLY SCRATCHED THE BACK PART OF HIS HEAD FOR THUS IT WAS
FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT
QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TO HIMSELF WHAT YON KNAVE IS AFTER THAT HE SHOULD GO THUS PEEPING AND PEERING ABOUT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YON SCURVY VARLET IS NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMETH HERE AFTER OUR OWN AND THE GOOD KING'S DUN DEER FOR
I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
NAY I PASS NOT FOR LENGTH ANSWERED THE TANNER MY STAFF IS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A CALF SO LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW I SAY AGAIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO EACH GRIPPED HIS STAFF IN THE MIDDLE AND WITH FELL AND ANGRY LOOKS THEY CAME SLOWLY TOGETHER
AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES
AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
I FEAR ME THOUGH THERE IS BUT POOR CHANCE OF MY SEEING SUCH A PLEASANT SIGHT SO SAYING HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT LENGTH UPON THE GROUND THAT HE MIGHT NOT ONLY SEE THE SPORT THE BETTER BUT THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY THE MERRY SIGHT AT HIS EASE
BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
AND THE TWO WICKED WRETCHES SEIZED FERKO'S LOAF AND ATE IT ALL UP WHILE THE POOR BOY WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN HE DID AWAKE HE FELT VERY HUNGRY AND TURNED TO EAT HIS BREAD BUT HIS BROTHERS CRIED OUT
LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
THAT HE SPOKE TO IT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER AND WASHED ITS SMALL PAWS WITH THE HEALING WATER IN A MOMENT THE MOUSE WAS SOUND AND WHOLE AND AFTER THANKING THE KIND PHYSICIAN IT SCAMPERED AWAY OVER THE PLOUGHED FURROWS
THIS SPLENDID PALACE HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE GRATEFUL QUEEN BEE WHO HAD SUMMONED ALL THE OTHER BEES IN THE KINGDOM TO HELP HER THE KING'S AMAZEMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND THE PRINCESS'S EYES BEAMED WITH DELIGHT
FERKO HIMSELF RETURNED TO THE FIELDS AND MOUNTING ON THE WOLF'S BACK HE RODE TO THE WOOD CLOSE BY QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE WOLF FLEW ROUND THE WOOD AND IN A MINUTE MANY HUNDRED WOLVES ROSE UP BEFORE HIM
TILL AT LAST THEY FELL ON THE KING AND ON THE WICKED BROTHERS AND ATE THEM AND THE WHOLE COURT UP IN A MOMENT THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND SET THE PRINCESS FREE AND ON THE SAME DAY
HE MARRIED HER AND WAS CROWNED KING OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WOLVES ALL WENT PEACEFULLY BACK TO THEIR OWN HOMES AND FERKO AND HIS BRIDE LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS TOGETHER
COME NOW TO MY CASTLE WITH ME AND LET US LIVE THERE HAPPILY TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE CASTLE WHERE THEY HAD BOTH ENDURED SO MUCH
DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS EMINENCE HAS BEEN MAKING FRESH COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR MUSKETEERS
AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
ARE THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE GUARDSMEN WHO BELONG TO THE CARDINAL YES TREVILLE YES SAID THE KING IN A MELANCHOLY TONE AND IT IS VERY SAD BELIEVE ME TO SEE THUS TWO PARTIES IN FRANCE TWO HEADS TO ROYALTY
LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
AND AS D'ARTAGNAN STOOD FIRM IT WAS HIS ADVERSARY WHO MADE THE RETREATING STEP BUT D'ARTAGNAN SEIZED THE MOMENT AT WHICH IN THIS MOVEMENT THE SWORD OF BERNAJOUX DEVIATED FROM THE LINE HE FREED HIS WEAPON MADE A LUNGE AND TOUCHED HIS ADVERSARY ON THE SHOULDER
BUT ON THE CONTRARY FOR HIM WHOSE PEOPLE THE MUSKETEERS HAD ASSAULTED AND WHOSE HOTEL THEY HAD ENDEAVORED TO BURN NOW AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN THESE TWO NOBLES MIGHT LAST A LONG TIME EACH BECOMING NATURALLY MORE FIRM IN HIS OWN OPINION
THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
THAT IS TRUE SIRE THERE CAN BE NO MORE DOUBT ON THAT HEAD THEY CALLED UPON HIM THEN TO RETIRE BUT HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS A MUSKETEER AT HEART ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY
D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
AT LENGTH HE WENT TO BED FELL ASLEEP AND HAD GOLDEN DREAMS
DOES NOT FIND SUCH STONES IN HIS MOTHER'S JEWEL CASE YOU THINK THEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DREAD ASKED D'ARTAGNAN I MEAN TO SAY YOUNG MAN THAT HE WHO SLEEPS OVER A MINE THE MATCH OF WHICH IS ALREADY LIGHTED
FAR FROM HERE OH LORD NO ABOUT FORTY LEAGUES ONLY
NOW LET US TALK ABOUT YOURSELF MY YOUNG FRIEND
AND YOU FOUND IT TRAITOROUS MONSIEUR INDEED
HARDLY REACHED TO THE WINDOW AT WHICH I SAT THE SHORN GRASS SLOPED GENTLY DOWNWARD FROM THE WINDOWS TILL IT MET THE BROAD LEVEL ON WHICH STOOD IN CLUMPS OR SOLITARILY SCATTERED SOME OF THE NOBLEST TIMBER IN ENGLAND
AND HAS TOLD ME ALL THAT CONCERNS US TO KNOW HE SAYS YOUR MAMMA IS NOT THERE SHE IS TAKEN AWAY I CRIED STARTING UP AND WITH STREAMING EYES GAZING ON THE BUILDING WHICH THOUGH I STAMPED MY FEET IN MY DISTRACTION
WHITE AND SHADOWY IN THE MOONLIGHT WHERE FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT RAMBLE WITH THE VISIONARY I FANCIED THE GATE OF DEATH HIDDEN ONLY BY A STRANGE GLAMOUR AND THE DAZZLING LAND OF GHOSTS WERE SITUATE
YOU MAY COME TO THE STORE ROOM NOW OR THE BUTLER CAN TAKE IT AND OFF WHISKED MISSUS RUSK FOR THE BACK STAIRCASE THERE HAD BEEN NO COMMON SKIRMISH ON THIS OCCASION BUT A PITCHED BATTLE MADAME HAD MADE A SORT OF PET OF ANNE WIXTED AN UNDERCHAMBERMAID
AS I APPROACHED I HAPPENED TO LOOK I CAN'T TELL WHY SUDDENLY OVER MY SHOULDER I WAS STARTLED FOR MADAME WAS GRIMACING AFTER ME WITH A VILE DERISIVE DISTORTION SHE PRETENDED TO BE SEIZED WITH A FIT OF COUGHING
SHE SAYS THERE IS GHOST HOW DARK IS THIS PLACE AND SO MANY OF THE RUTHYN FAMILY THEY ARE BURIED HERE IS NOT SO HOW HIGH AND THICK ARE THE TREES ALL ROUND AND NOBODY COMES NEAR
WAT GOOD MAN IS YOUR FATHER VERY THE KINDEST DARLING I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS MADAME I AM SO AFRAID OF HIM AND NEVER COULD TELL HIM HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM THIS CONFIDENTIAL TALKING WITH MADAME STRANGE TO SAY
WHAT CROSS GIRL I WILL NEVER PLAY WITH YOU AGAIN NEVER LET US GO HOME MADAME WAS SILENT AND MOROSE ALL THE WAY HOME SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER MY QUESTIONS AND AFFECTED TO BE VERY LOFTY AND OFFENDED
HOW IS MADAME I ASKED QUITE WELL I BELIEVE ANSWERED THE HOUSEKEEPER DRILY NOTHING THE MATTER THAT I KNOW OF SHE EAT ENOUGH FOR TWO TO DAY
I RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM
THAT I THINK I SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED IF THE SENTIMENT HAD NOT BEEN SO AWFULLY IRREVERENT WELL DEAR HOW IS OUR FRIEND THE MILLINER MADAME IS SUFFERING SO MUCH FROM PAIN IN HER EAR THAT SHE SAYS IT WOULD BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE THE HONOUR HONOUR FIDDLE
SHE SCALED THE STAIRS I FOLLOWING AND HAVING FOUND THE REMEDIES WE APPROACHED MADAME'S ROOM TOGETHER I THINK WHILE WE WERE STILL AT THE END OF THE GALLERY MADAME HEARD AND DIVINED OUR APPROACH FOR HER DOOR SUDDENLY SHUT
YOU FEEL VERY SLEEPY AS HE DID THIS SEVERAL OF THE VOLUNTEERS CLOSED THEIR EYES AT ONCE AND ONE FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO REMAINED AWAKE
THE SUGGESTION WAS REPEATED AND AS THE GLAZED LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES THE INCREDULOUS LOOK DIED OUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE CLASS WAS FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTION MADE TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME EXPRESSION IN THEIR EYES THE DOCTOR SAID
HE LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN DASHED DOWN THE PLATFORM INTO THE AUDIENCE AND SEIZING THE MAN'S HEAD VIGOROUSLY RUBBED IT AS THIS DID NOT EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND PUT THE FIRE OUT IN DOING THIS HE SET HIS COAT ON FIRE
HOW THE SUBJECT FEELS UNDER HYPNOTIZATION DOCTOR COOPER'S EXPERIENCE EFFECT OF MUSIC DOCTOR ALFRED MARTHIEU'S EXPERIMENTS
THE OPERATOR SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SLEEP YOU ARE GETTING SLEEPY YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MY HEART WAS BEATING RAPIDLY AND I FELT A SENSATION OF TERROR
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE HYPNOTIST COMMANDED ME TO AWAKE AS SOON AS I DROPPED MY ARM AND YET TEN MINUTES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HAD PASSED ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION DOCTOR COCKE WHO WAS BLIND WAS PUT INTO A DEEP HYPNOTIC SLEEP
AND IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN DELIBERATELY HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF WHEN HE WISHES TO TILL HE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND IS EXPERT IN IT SO TO SPEAK IT DOES AWAY AT A STROKE WITH THE CLAIMS OF ALL PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTISTS AND MAGNETIC HEALERS
PROBABLY NO SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON WAS EVER SO GROSSLY PROSTITUTED TO BASE ENDS AS THAT OF HYPNOTISM LATER WE SHALL SEE SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FORMS THIS CHARLATANISM ASSUMES
BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
GAZING STEADILY AT A BED OF BRIGHT COALS OR A STREAM OF RUNNING WATER WILL INVARIABLY THROW A SENSITIVE SUBJECT INTO A HYPNOTIC SLEEP THAT WILL LAST SOMETIMES FOR SEVERAL HOURS DOCTOR COCKE SAYS
WHICH WHEN THE EAST WIND WAS STRAINING FLEW LOW OVERHEAD TO PITCH TO THE LAKE IN THE FORBIDDEN PRECINCTS OF THE DEER PARK BEYOND THE BROW OF THE HILL
BUT AT THE BEST ONLY RUDE STORIES AND JESTS RECITED BY SOME STROLLING MUMMER OR MINSTREL TO THE LISTENING CIRCLE GATHERED AROUND THE BLAZE AND WELCOMING THE COARSE GROSS JESTS AND COARSER GROSSER SONGS WITH ROARS OF BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER
WHOLE BARRELS OF ALE AND MALMSEY WERE BROACHED AND ALL THE FOLK GENTLE AND SIMPLE WERE BIDDEN TO THE FEAST AFTERWARDS THE MINSTRELS DANCED AND PLAYED A RUDE PLAY AND IN THE EVENING A MIRACLE SHOW WAS PERFORMED ON A RAISED PLATFORM IN THE NORTH HALL
FOR A WEEK AFTERWARDS THE CASTLE WAS FED UPON THE REMAINS OF THE GOOD THINGS LEFT FROM THAT GREAT FEAST UNTIL EVERYONE GREW TO LOATHE FINE VICTUALS AND LONGED FOR HONEST BEEF AND MUSTARD AGAIN THEN AT LAST IN THAT CONSTANT CHANGE THE WINTER WAS GONE
AND EVEN THE LADS WHO HAD ENJOYED ITS PASSING WERE GLAD WHEN THE WINDS BLEW WARM ONCE MORE AND THE GRASS SHOWED GREEN IN SUNNY PLACES AND THE LEADER OF THE WILD FOWL BLEW HIS HORN AS THEY WHO IN THE FALL HAD FLOWN TO THE SOUTH FLEW ARROW LIKE NORTHWARD AGAIN
HAND UNDER HAND UNTIL AT LAST HE HUNG DIRECTLY OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND PERHAPS A FOOT ABOVE IT BELOW HIM HE COULD SEE THE LEAFY TOP OF AN ARBOR COVERED WITH A THICK GROWTH OF CLEMATIS AND EVEN AS HE HUNG THERE
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO DRAW BACK NOW BRACING HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT HE LOOSED HIS HOLD UPON THE LIMB ABOVE THE BRANCH FLEW BACK WITH A RUSH AND HE DROPPED STRIVING TO GRASP THE SLOPING ANGLE WITH HIS FEET
SO I THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW PAINFUL A PERSON'S BONES CAN BE BUT I'VE SYMPATHIZED WITH YOU A GREAT DEAL AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE BETTER SHE'S A VERY GOOD APPLE WOMAN HE SAID TO MISTER HAVISHAM AS THEY WALKED AWAY
DICK HAD JUST BEEN HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WITH JAKE AND WAS IN LOW SPIRITS WHEN THEY SAW HIM HIS AMAZEMENT WHEN CEDRIC CALMLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD COME TO GIVE HIM WHAT SEEMED A VERY GREAT THING TO HIM AND WOULD SET ALL HIS TROUBLES RIGHT
IT WAS OF BRIGHT RED SILK ORNAMENTED WITH PURPLE HORSESHOES AND HORSES HEADS THERE WAS A GREAT STRAINING AND CREAKING AND CONFUSION THE PEOPLE ON THE WHARF BEGAN TO SHOUT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND THE PEOPLE ON THE STEAMER SHOUTED BACK
THE MORE EXCITED THEY BECAME SEEMS LIKE SOMETHIN ORTER BE DONE SAID MISTER HOBBS THINGS LIKE THEM ORTER BE HELD ON TO EARLS OR NO EARLS BUT THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO
THIS IS WHAT MISTER HOBBS READ IN DICK'S LETTER DERE FREND
IT APPEARS THERE HAS BEEN SOME DUBIOUSNESS ABOUT THE CHILD THE WOMAN CONTRADICTED HERSELF IN SOME OF HER STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS AGE AND AROUSED SUSPICION THE FIRST PERSONS TO BE WRITTEN TO ARE DICK'S BROTHER AND THE EARL OF DORINCOURT'S FAMILY LAWYER
THIS PURGING OF ALL THE DROSS OF TRIVIALITY AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE FURNACE OF POVERTY TRIAL AND SORROW GAVE ELOQUENCE TO HIS BRUSH AND ENABLED HIM TO PAINT AS NEVER BEFORE AS NO PROSPERITY WOULD HAVE MADE POSSIBLE
THERE IS BUT ONE QUESTION FOR HIM TO ANSWER TO FACE BOLDLY AND HONESTLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL ALONE WITH HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS DESTINY HOW WILL I LET THAT POVERTY OR WEALTH AFFECT ME IF THAT TRIAL OR DEPRIVATION HAS LEFT ME BETTER
HAVE HAD THEIR SOURCE AND THEIR TRICKLING INCREASE INTO VOLUME AMONG THE DARK GLOOMY RECESSES OF OUR FAILURE THERE IS NO HONEST AND TRUE WORK
WHICH TAKES OVER THE USUAL STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS TYPE OF THINKING IT IS IMPLIED THAT THE PROCESS MAY BE ATAVISTIC ONE OF THE NEWER THEORIES ONE HELD BY DOCTOR LEWIS R WOLBERG A PSYCHOANALYST
BEGIN NOW STOP TALKING ABOUT BEING TOO OLD TO GROW YOU PASS BY TREES DAILY A HUNDRED
EVEN TO A DARK LANTERN THE END OF THE FILM IS SURE TO BE JOLLY GOOD CHEER ATTRACTS GOOD LUCK CHEER UP IF YOU HAVEN'T A SMILE GET ONE OF SOMEBODY AND WEAR IT AS YOUR OWN
OF ABSOLUTE PERSONALITY NOTHING THAT HAS LIFE IS GOD DAMNED WHERE LOVE IS ONLY A DREAM THE MARRIAGE IS AN ALARM CLOCK IF YOU CANNOT ENDURE YOUR MOTHER IN LAW
AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
NOW MISTER MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE CALMNESS I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I CANNOT DO WITH THIS I LIKE YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE I AM ALONE HERE
AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
I WILL NOT I REPLIED BUT YOU PARDON THIS OFFENCE ON CONDITION THAT YOU NEVER REPEAT IT AND MAY I COME TO SEE YOU NOW AND THEN PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY
IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
JANE WILSON THINKS YOUR VISITS TO THE OLD HALL BUT ANOTHER PROOF OF HER DEPRAVITY CONFOUND JANE WILSON AND ELIZA MILLWARD IS QUITE GRIEVED ABOUT YOU I HOPE SHE IS
YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
O KING I SEE YOU A FAMOUS CONQUEROR THE MASTER OF MANY NATIONS I SEE YOU GOING FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY DEFEATING ARMIES AND DESTROYING CITIES UNTIL MEN CALL YOU THE FEAR OF THE WORLD YOU HEAP UP VAST RICHES
HE WAS SO ENRAGED AT THIS THAT HE AGAIN BEGAN WAR
HE ATTACKED AND DESTROYED TOWNS AND KILLED THE INHABITANTS WITHOUT MERCY THE PEOPLE HAD SUCH DREAD OF HIM THAT HE WAS CALLED THE SCOURGE OF GOD AND THE FEAR OF THE WORLD THREE
WHEN HE WAS BUT TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HE WAS LAME IN ONE LEG AND LOOKED AS IF HE WERE A VERY ORDINARY PERSON LIKE MOST OF THE VANDALS HE WAS A CRUEL AND CUNNING MAN BUT HE HAD GREAT ABILITY IN MANY WAYS
BUT HE FIRST MARCHED HIS MEN ACROSS THE ALPS THROUGH GAUL AND DOWN TO THE SEAPORT OF CARTHAGENA IN SPAIN WHERE HIS FLEET WAS STATIONED HE TOOK THIS ROUTE BECAUSE HE EXPECTED TO ADD TO HIS FORCES
BUT THE CUNNING VANDAL WAS NOT THINKING OF PEACE HE ONLY WANTED TIME TO CARRY OUT A PLAN HE HAD MADE TO DESTROY THE ROMAN FLEET ONE DARK NIGHT DURING THE TRUCE HE FILLED THE LARGEST OF HIS SHIPS
JUSTINIAN REIGNED FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS AND DID SO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HE WAS AFTERWARDS CALLED JUSTINIAN THE GREAT HE HAD MANY WARS DURING HIS REIGN BUT HE HIMSELF DID NOT TAKE PART IN THEM
AND SOON THEY CAME TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND WERE MARRIED AS HE WAS NOW THE HUSBAND OF A RICH WOMAN HE DID NOT NEED TO WORK VERY HARD HE STILL CONTINUED TO ATTEND TO HIS WIFE'S BUSINESS BUT HE DID NOT MAKE SO MANY JOURNEYS AS BEFORE
IN A CAVE ON MOUNT HIRA NEAR MECCA HE SPENT SEVERAL WEEKS EVERY YEAR IN PRAYER AND RELIGIOUS MEDITATION HE DECLARED THAT WHILE PRAYING IN HIS CAVE HE OFTEN HAD VISIONS OF GOD AND HEAVEN
SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES AT THE FEET OF HER HUSBAND AND CRIED OUT THERE IS BUT ONE GOD MOHAMMED IS GOD'S PROPHET MOHAMMED THEN TOLD THE STORY TO OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY SOME OF THEM BELIEVED AND BECAME HIS FIRST FOLLOWERS
SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE HE SPOKE IN THE MARKET AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES
AND WISHED HIM TO COME AND LIVE AMONG THEM SO HE SECRETLY LEFT HIS NATIVE TOWN AND FLED FROM HIS ENEMIES WITH A FEW FAITHFUL COMPANIONS HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO MEDINA
BUT HAS BECOME DARK FROM BEING WEPT UPON AND TOUCHED BY SO MANY MILLIONS OF PILGRIMS IT REALLY IS REDDISH BROWN IN COLOR BEFORE THE TIME OF MOHAMMED THE KA'A BA WAS A PAGAN TEMPLE
WHO WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY SOON THE NAUTILUS REENTERED ITS LIQUID ELEMENT AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT IT WAS STAYING AT A DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET WITH THE CHART UNDER MY EYES
NECKS AND EARS THAT'S OBLONG IN SHAPE GLASSY IN LUSTER AND FORMED FROM MOTHER OF PEARL FOR CHEMISTS IT'S A MIXTURE OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE WITH A LITTLE GELATIN PROTEIN
THE PEAR SHAPED ONES INTO EARRINGS AND SINCE THEY'RE THE MOST VALUABLE THEY'RE PRICED INDIVIDUALLY THE OTHER PEARLS THAT STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL ARE MORE ERRATICALLY SHAPED AND ARE PRICED BY WEIGHT FINALLY CLASSED IN THE LOWEST ORDER
BUT I DON'T THINK THESE FISHERIES BRING IN THE RETURNS THEY ONCE DID SIMILARLY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN FISHERIES
THEIR VISION WEAKENS ULCERS BREAK OUT ON THEIR EYES SORES FORM ON THEIR BODIES AND SOME ARE EVEN STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY ON THE OCEAN FLOOR YES I SAID IT'S A SAD OCCUPATION
THE FISHERMEN ARE WELL PAID AREN'T THEY HARDLY PROFESSOR IN PANAMA THEY MAKE JUST ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK IN MOST PLACES THEY EARN ONLY A PENNY FOR EACH OYSTER THAT HAS A PEARL AND THEY BRING UP SO MANY THAT HAVE NONE
ONLY ONE PENNY TO THOSE POOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYERS RICH THAT'S ATROCIOUS ON THAT NOTE PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME
IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT LIONS ON THE ATLAS PLAINS OR TIGERS IN THE JUNGLES OF INDIA YOU MIGHT SAY HA NOW'S MY CHANCE TO HUNT LIONS AND TIGERS BUT IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT SHARKS IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT
THE CANADIAN SAID BUT SAID CONSEIL WHO PERPETUALLY RETURNED TO THE DIDACTIC SIDE OF THINGS IS THIS PEARL FISHING EVER DANGEROUS NO I REPLIED QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF ONE TAKES CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS
IF YOU HAVE LIVED IN CITIES AND HAVE WALKED IN THE PARK ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON YOU HAVE PERHAPS SEEN BLINKING IN A CORNER OF HIS IRON CAGE
HIS NECK THIN HIS LEGS FEEBLE HE WAS DIRTY EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS UNCLEAN EVEN THE WHITES OF HIS EYES LOOKED SOILED I GO TOO FAST NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT WASH WAS UNCLEAN
BITCHES HE CALLED THEM HIS FEELING TOWARD MEN WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT HE PITIED THEM DOES NOT EVERY MAN LET HIS LIFE BE MANAGED FOR HIM BY SOME BITCH OR ANOTHER HE ASKED
HE TORE IT UP AND LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN WIFE AS HE TORE UP THE LETTER WASH WILLIAMS ONCE HAD A WIFE WHEN HE WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN HE MARRIED A WOMAN AT DAYTON OHIO
BESIDE THE RAILROAD STATION AND SAW WASH WILLIAMS APPARENTLY ASLEEP ON THE GRASS BENEATH A TREE ON THE NEXT EVENING THE OPERATOR AND GEORGE WILLARD WALKED OUT TOGETHER DOWN THE RAILROAD THEY WENT
HATRED HAD RAISED HIM TO THAT ELEVATION IT IS BECAUSE I SAW YOU KISSING THE LIPS OF THAT BELLE CARPENTER THAT I TELL YOU MY STORY HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO ME MAY NEXT HAPPEN TO YOU
WITH A KIND OF RELIGIOUS FERVOR HE HAD MANAGED TO GO THROUGH THE PITFALLS OF HIS YOUTH AND TO REMAIN VIRGINAL UNTIL AFTER HIS MARRIAGE HE MADE FOR GEORGE WILLARD A PICTURE OF HIS LIFE IN THE HOUSE AT COLUMBUS OHIO WITH THE YOUNG WIFE
THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
THERE CAN BE NO NOBLER CAUSE FOR WHICH TO WORK THAN THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIGH HONOR IS DUE THOSE SERENE AND LOFTY SOULS WHO WITH WISDOM AND COURAGE
WHO WERE INCAPABLE OF OPPRESSING THE WEAK OR OF PERMITTING THEIR COUNTRY WITH THEIR CONSENT TO OPPRESS THE WEAK BUT WHO DID NOT HESITATE TO DRAW THE SWORD WHEN TO LEAVE IT UNDRAWN MEANT INABILITY TO ARREST TRIUMPHANT WRONG
IN THE FEELING FOR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUSTICE AMONG THE GREAT CIVILIZED NATIONS DURING THE PAST THREESCORE OR FOURSCORE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL GROWTH OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
EITHER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS AGAINST THEIR OWN CITIZENS OR TO PROTECT THEIR OWN CITIZENS AGAINST FOREIGNERS THAT IT BECOMES A MATTER OF SHEER DUTY FOR SOME OUTSIDE POWER TO INTERFERE IN CONNECTION WITH THEM
OF OUTSIDERS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE POWER TO FIGHT JAPAN STANDS ON A FOOTING OF EQUALITY WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN NATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES POSSESS THIS POWER CHINA NOW SEES JAPAN
LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
FOR INSULATION WE USED CELLULOSE PULP THE FLOOR AND THE CEILING BETWEEN THE ROOMS AND THE LOFT WERE DOUBLE
THE DOORS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY THICK AND STRONG AND FITTED INTO OBLIQUE GROOVES SO THAT THEY CLOSED VERY TIGHTLY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS A TRIPLE ONE IN THE END WALL OF THE MAIN ROOM AND A DOUBLE ONE IN THE KITCHEN
THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF WOOLLEN GLOVES WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE OTHERS GREATLY PRIZED FOR MYSELF I WAS NEVER ABLE TO WEAR SUCH THINGS THEY SIMPLY FREEZE THE FINGERS OFF ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THE COVERING OF THE FEET
I WANT THE SKI TO BE A PART OF ONESELF SO THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS FULL COMMAND OF THEM I HAVE TRIED MANY PATENTS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF A STIFF FASTENING IN COLD TEMPERATURES BUT ALL THESE PATENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE WORTHLESS IN THE LONG RUN
I DECIDED THIS TIME TO TRY A COMBINATION OF STIFF AND SOFT FOOT GEAR SO THAT WE COULD USE THE SPLENDID HUITFELDT HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS BUT THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER OF OUR WHOLE OUTFIT NOTHING CAUSED ME MORE WORRY
WHICH IS SLIPPED OVER THE ANIMAL'S HEAD AND MAKES THE WEIGHT OF THE PULL COME ON HIS SHOULDERS WHEREAS THE GREENLAND HARNESS PRESSES ON HIS CHEST RAW PLACES WHICH OCCUR RATHER FREQUENTLY WITH THE GREENLAND HARNESS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY AVOIDED WITH THE OTHER
HOW EXCELLENT THESE GLASSES ARE APPEARS CLEARLY ENOUGH FROM THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF SNOW BLINDNESS ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF THE PEMMICAN I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A WHOLE GROCER'S SHOP WITH ME WHEN SLEDGING THE FOOD SHOULD BE SIMPLE AND NOURISHING AND THAT IS ENOUGH A RICH AND VARIED MENU IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO WORK TO DO
HOW OFTEN ONE READS IN NARRATIVES OF POLAR TRAVEL THAT IT TOOK SUCH AND SUCH A TIME OFTEN HOURS TO SET UP THE TENT AND THEN WHEN AT LAST IT WAS UP ONE LAY EXPECTING IT TO BE BLOWN DOWN AT ANY MOMENT
ALONG THE UPPER OR SOUTHERN SIDE OF THIS GARDEN RAN A TERRACE OF THE FINEST TURF
HAVING THEIR SUMMER THEATRE IN THE BARN AND THEIR WINTER ONE WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE DINING ROOM WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED ON THESE OCCASIONS THE PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES WERE WRITTEN BY JANE'S ELDEST BROTHER
AND IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS AND FEELINGS WHICH ARE SO VIVIDLY PAINTED IN THE MANSFIELD PARK THEATRICALS ARE DUE TO HER RECOLLECTIONS OF THESE ENTERTAINMENTS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY LEFT STEVENTON ONE GREAT AFFLICTION CAME UPON THE FAMILY
BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THE RISING GENERATION ARE EQUALLY AWARE HOW MUCH GENTLEMEN ALSO DID FOR THEMSELVES IN THOSE TIMES
IT WAS THOUGHT MERITORIOUS ON THE EVENING OF A HUNTING DAY TO TURN OUT AFTER DINNER LANTHORN IN HAND AND VISIT THE STABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE HORSE HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR THIS WAS OF THE MORE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF CLIPPING ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY
WHICH WOULD APPEAR TO US LAMENTABLY SCANTY THERE WAS A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF CARPETING IN SITTING ROOMS BED ROOMS AND PASSAGES A PIANOFORTE OR RATHER A SPINNET OR HARPSICHORD WAS BY NO MEANS A NECESSARY APPENDAGE
AND A MODEL GENTLEMAN OF HIS DAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE THE TOUR OF EUROPE WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING THE BACK OF HIS TRAVELLING CARRIAGE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE MOST STRUCK WITH THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF THOSE ELEGANT LITTLE ARTICLES WHICH NOW EMBELLISH AND ENCUMBER OUR DRAWING ROOM TABLES
A SMALL WRITING DESK WITH A SMALLER WORK BOX OR NETTING CASE WAS ALL THAT EACH YOUNG LADY CONTRIBUTED TO OCCUPY THE TABLE FOR THE LARGE FAMILY WORK BASKET THOUGH OFTEN PRODUCED IN THE PARLOUR LIVED IN THE CLOSET
TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
TIGHT PACKED THE MASS OF PEOPLE JOSTLED ELBOWED AND PUSHED GOOD NATUREDLY IT WAS A VOICE NOW HER VOICE THAT HE WAS LISTENING FOR BUT THOUGH IT SEEMED THAT EVERY FACULTY WAS STRAINED AND INTENT UPON THAT ONE EFFORT
INDEED IT SEEMED A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME NOW SINCE HE HAD HEARD FROM HER EVEN IN THAT WAY THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO MANY DAYS AGO AFTER ALL PERHAPS IT WAS THE CALM AS IT WERE THAT BY CONTRAST
WITH THEIR PROSPEROUS WELL GROOMED ESCORTS THERE WAS THE WOWZER OVER THERE SLEEK DAPPER SQUIRMING IN AND OUT OF THE THRONG WITH THE AGILITY AND STEALTH OF A CAT AS LARRY THE BAT HE HAD MET THE WOWZER MANY TIMES
JIMMIE DALE A BLOCK DOWN HE TURNED FROM BROADWAY OUT OF THE THEATRE CROWDS THAT STREAMED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS PAST HIM THE LETTER
THERE WAS AMPLE LIGHT TO READ BY EVEN AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AS THE CURB AND JIMMIE DALE WITH AN APPROVING NOD TURNED THE CORNER AND WALKED ALONG A FEW STEPS UNTIL OPPOSITE THE FARTHEST WINDOW BUT
HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE FROM THE SIDEWALK WATCHING WITH A SORT OF SPECULATIVE SATISFACTION A MAN'S SHADOW THAT PASSED CONSTANTLY TO AND FRO ACROSS THE DRAWN BLINDS OF ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS
THOUGH I EXPECTED YOU WOULD TELEPHONE RATHER THAN THIS COME IN THANK YOU SAID JIMMIE DALE COURTEOUSLY AND STEPPED INTO THE HALL THE OTHER CLOSED THE FRONT DOOR THE SERVANTS ARE IN BED OF COURSE
HELD A DISCONCERTING BEAD ON CARLING'S FOREHEAD PLEASE DON'T DO THAT SAID JIMMIE DALE SOFTLY IT'S RATHER A GOOD MAKE THAT SAFE I DARE SAY IT WOULD TAKE ME HALF AN HOUR TO OPEN IT
A DAWNING LOOK OF TERROR IN THE EYES THAT HELD FASCINATED ON JIMMIE DALE YOU CUR SAID JIMMIE DALE AGAIN YOU CUR WITH YOUR DEVIL'S WORK A YEAR AGO YOU SAW THIS NIGHT COMING
THE EX CONVICT IN THE BANK'S EMPLOY YOU KNEW MOYNE WAS DINING OUT TO NIGHT YOU KNEW WHERE AND AT A HINT FROM YOU THE POLICE TOOK UP THE TRAIL A LITTLE LATER IN THE EVENING YOU TOOK THESE TWO PACKAGES OF BANKNOTES FROM THE REST
STARING AT THEM THEN METHODICALLY BEGAN TO TEAR THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES A STRANGE TIRED SMILE HOVERING ON HIS LIPS THE MAN WAS DEAD NOW THERE WOULD BE DISGRACE ENOUGH FOR SOME ONE TO BEAR A MOTHER PERHAPS
SAID JIMMIE DALE SLOWLY I HAVEN'T COUNTED IT YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED THIS EVENING AT CLOSING TIME I UNDERSTAND YES CARLING'S VOICE WAS EXCITED NOW
IN MOYNE'S HOME UP IN HARLEM
I TOLD HIM WHAT SNAP AND I HAD LEARNED THE RAYS FROM THE MOON PROVING THAT GRANTLINE HAD CONCENTRATED A CONSIDERABLE ORE BODY I ALSO TOLD HIM OF GRANTLINE'S MESSAGE WE'LL STOP ON THE WAY BACK AS HE DIRECTS GREGG HE BENT CLOSER TO ME
WHEN I MENTIONED THE PURSER WHO SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WATCHING ME EARLIER IN THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WAS SITTING IN THE SMOKING ROOM WHEN THE EAVESDROPPER FLED PAST CARTER LOOKED STARTLED JOHNSON IS ALL RIGHT GREGG DOES HE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS GRANTLINE AFFAIR NO
BUT WHY DIDN'T JOHNSON HEAR THAT EAVESDROPPER AND WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE ANYWAY AT THAT HOUR OF THE MORNING THE CAPTAIN IGNORED MY QUESTIONS I'M GOING TO HAVE THAT PRINCE SUITE SEARCHED WE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL GO TO BED GREGG YOU NEED REST
IT WAS A LOW VAULTED METAL ROOM WITH BLUE AND YELLOW TUBE LIGHTS AT ITS SIDES THE OVAL WINDOWS SHOWED THE DECK WITH ITS PORTS ON THE DOME SIDE THROUGH WHICH A VISTA OF THE STARRY FIRMAMENT WAS VISIBLE WE WERE WELL ON OUR COURSE TO MARS
I SHOULD HAVE HEARD OF YOU NO DOUBT BUT A SMILE PLUCKED AT HIS THIN GRAY LIPS
I DEAL IN TRICKS HOW TO FOOL AN AUDIENCE HIS KEEN AMUSED GAZE WAS ON OB HAHN THIS GENTLEMAN FROM VENUS AND I HAVE TOO MUCH IN COMMON TO ARGUE
I GAZED AFTER HIS SMALL WHITE SUITED FIGURE AS HE FOLLOWED ANITA FROM THE SALON AND THINKING OF HER I PRAYED THAT CARTER AND HALSEY MIGHT BE WRONG WHATEVER PLOTTING AGAINST THE GRANTLINE EXPEDITION MIGHT BE GOING ON
THE MARTIAN EQUIVALENT OF MISTER AND MISS
NO MAN WILL PLEASE ME MORE
BUT NOT WITHIN EARSHOT WHY DO YOU LOOK SO FURTIVE SHE RETORTED GREGG THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS VOYAGE
I PARRIED I MEAN A LOT OF THINGS WHAT WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT WAS THE EXCITEMENT YOU WERE IN JUST BEFORE BREAKFAST THIS MORNING EXCITEMENT GREGG YOU MAY TRUST ME FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE WAS WHOLLY SERIOUS
I SAW THE DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE I EVEN THOUGHT I COULD SEE HIS BLURRED OUTLINE SHE ADDED WHY SHOULD GEORGE PRINCE BE SNEAKING AROUND WITH YOU AFTER HIM AND THE PURSER ACTING INNOCENT
I SAT STARING AT HER SHE WAS A MINE OF INFORMATION THIS GIRL AND GREGG I TRIED MY CHARMS ON SHAC AND DUD NICE MEN BUT DUMB WHATEVER'S GOING ON THEY'RE NOT IN IT
HE'S A MAN FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN SHE DREW AWAY FROM ME ABRUPTLY THERE'S ANITA AND GEORGE PRINCE THEY CAME TO THE CORNER OF THE DECK BUT TURNED BACK VENZA CAUGHT MY LOOK AND UNDERSTOOD IT
MOA WITH A NIGHTROBE DRAWN TIGHT AROUND HER THIN TALL FIGURE EDGED UP TO ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED SET HALJAN
TORTURED SLEEP I WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF MY ALARM BUZZER SOMEONE WAS TAMPERING WITH MY DOOR THEN THE BUZZER CEASED THE MARAUDER OUTSIDE MUST HAVE FOUND A WAY OF SILENCING IT BUT IT HAD DONE ITS WORK AWAKENED ME
AND HEAR HIM I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU HALJAN WE NEED YOU HE GATHERED ME UP LIKE A BUNDLE IN HIS HUGE ARMS CARRIED ME SWIFTLY ACROSS THE DESERTED DECK
DOCTOR FRANK GRIPPED ME THE CAPTAIN SAID GENTLY WE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL GREGG SHE TOLD US BEFORE SHE DIED I'LL BRING HIM IN HERE TO YOU BUT I'LL KILL HIM I TELL YOU NO YOU WON'T LAD
THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
FOR INFORMATION ON THESE MATTERS THEY MUST GO TO LARGER AND MORE TECHNICAL WORKS MY AIM HERE IS THE MORE GENERAL ONE OF INDICATING FIRST THE CHARACTERISTIC EXPERIENCES DISCOVERABLE WITHIN ALL GREAT RELIGIONS
AND BY RECENT WORK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AUTISTIC THOUGHT AND OF SUGGESTION THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE A PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR EVERY MAN WHO DESIRES TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL
AND THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING SYMBOLS AND CULTS THESE CHAPTERS LEAD UP TO A DISCUSSION OF THE PERSONAL ASPECT OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE ITS CURVE OF GROWTH CHARACTERS AND ACTIVITIES
WARM GRATITUDE FIRST TO THE PRINCIPAL AND AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE WHO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY OF DELIVERING THESE CHAPTERS IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND WHOSE UNFAILING SYMPATHY AND KINDNESS SO GREATLY HELPED ME
CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MISSUS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
CARRIED DAINTY MESSES TO THEIR SICK RESOLVED BEFORE LONG TO TEACH AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HER FATHER WENT EVERY DAY AS TO AN APPOINTED TASK BUT SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TEMPTED OFF TO GO AND SEE SOME INDIVIDUAL FRIEND
WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT
HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER
WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
AND HE JERKED HIS THUMB AT MASKEW
AND HOW HE DID IT IN SUCH A NARROW STRAIT I KNOW NOT BUT HE TURNED ROUND AND LYING DOWN HIMSELF THRUST HIS HAND FIRMLY IN MY BACK PRESSING ME CLOSER TO THE CLIFF YET IT WAS NONE TOO SOON FOR IF HE HAD NOT HELD ME TIGHT
THOUGH THERE IS NOT NOW MUCH FARTHER TO GO WE HAVE PASSED PURBECK GATES AND THESE WALLS WILL SCREEN US FROM PRYING EYES IF ANY CHANCE COMER PASS ALONG THE DOWN AND AS FOR THE SOLDIERS THEY ARE NOT LIKE TO COME THIS WAY SO SOON
AND NOW THAT I WAS UNDER THE LEE OF THE WALL
FOR WHILE HE SPOKE I SAW THAT HIS EYE HAD FALLEN ON MY FOOT THOUGH I TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE SHADOW AND THAT HE SAW THE BOOT CLOTTED WITH BLOOD AND THE KERCHIEF TIED ROUND MY LEG TIS FOR THAT VERY REASON SAYS ELZEVIR THAT I WANT THE FIRELOCK
FROM THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHAFT THERE SPREAD OUT NARROW PASSAGES OR TUNNELS MOSTLY SIX FEET HIGH BUT SOMETIMES ONLY THREE OR FOUR AND IN THESE THE MARBLE IS DUG THESE QUARRIES WERE MADE BY MEN CENTURIES AGO SOME SAY BY THE ROMANS THEMSELVES
THERE HE SAID THIS IS JOSEPH'S PIT AND HERE WE MUST LIE HID UNTIL THY FOOT IS SOUND AGAIN ONCE GET TO THE BOTTOM SAFE AND WE CAN LAUGH AT POSSE AND HUE AND CRY
AND CARRY ME IN A VERY CONSTRAINED ATTITUDE ONLY TWICE DID HE SET ME DOWN AT A TURNING WHILE HE TOOK OUT HIS TINDER BOX AND LIT A MATCH
AND YET BEFORE THAT THEY BE CLEAN DISPERST
SAID GARGANTUA THE PROGRESS AND CARRYING ON OF THE DIVINE TRUTH BY SAINT GODERAN SAID THE MONK THAT IS NOT MY EXPOSITION IT IS THE STYLE OF THE PROPHET MERLIN
MAKE UPON IT AS MANY GRAVE ALLEGORIES AND GLOSSES AS YOU WILL AND DOTE UPON IT YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE FOR MY PART
ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY AFTER STARTING OUT
WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
WHICH MADE ME THUS UNGENEROUS OF HIS NAME OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEELING THAT THE OTHERS WERE NOT WORTHY OF HIM BUT HOW REFRESHING IT WAS WHEN SOME INTELLECTUALLY BLOWN UP STRANGER SAID DO YOU EVER READ SAKI
HAD GONE OUT TO AN EARLY CHURCH SERVICE TO PROCURE FROM HIS EMPLOYER'S CUPBOARD
HE WROTE I AM WRITING YOU A LETTER
THEY MAKE ME SLEEP IN THE VESTIBULE AND WHEN THEIR BRAT CRIES I DON'T SLEEP AT ALL BUT HAVE TO ROCK THE CRADLE DEAR GRANDPAPA FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TAKE ME AWAY FROM HERE
BUT I HAVE NO BOOTS AND I WAS AFRAID OF THE FROST AND WHEN I GROW UP I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU
BUSIED HERSELF MOST ABOUT IT WHEN LITTLE VANKA'S MOTHER PELAGUEYA WAS STILL ALIVE AND WAS SERVANT WOMAN IN THE HOUSE OLGA IGNATYEVNA USED TO STUFF HIM WITH SUGAR CANDY AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO
AND I AM FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY AND SO SAD THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU I CRY ALL THE TIME THE OTHER DAY THE MASTER HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A LAST I FELL TO THE GROUND AND ONLY JUST RETURNED TO LIFE
SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
SAINT BRIDE'S SIX SAINT JAMES'S NINE
AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
WAS SUCH THAT THE TOWN WAS COMPUTED TO HAVE IN IT ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER IT HELD BEFORE NAY SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO SAY IT HAD TWICE AS MANY BECAUSE
NO MATTER HOW BRAVELY THEY STROVE TO MEET THE SITUATION HOW CAN WE PROVIDE FOR OURSELVES AND THESE LITTLE SISTERS WAS A QUESTION WHICH HAUNTED THEM BY NIGHT AND PERPLEXED THEM BY DAY
THE REPORT OF OUR AFFLICTION SPREAD RAPIDLY AND THE WELL MEANING TENDER HEARTED WOMEN AT THE FORT CAME TO CONDOLE AND WEEP WITH US AND MADE THEIR CHILDREN WEEP ALSO BY URGING
FLOATING NEAR THE END OF THE BOARD AND LAY DOWN UPON IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CATCHING THEM
EXCITED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN RUSHED TO TOWN IN QUEST OF INFORMATION IT WAS FURNISHED BY
AND THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WOULD FIND COMPANY H EQUALLY DESERVING OF HER CONSIDERATION SHE READILY EXTENDED TO THE NEW MEN THE HOMELIKE PRIVILEGES WHICH THE OTHERS HAD ENJOYED THUS MORE FRIENDS CAME AMONG US
LAWD HONEY YO NEEDN'T HAVE NO PUNCTIONS BOUT TAKIN DIS YER BOOK
SENORA VALLEJO TOOK ME BY THE HAND SAYING IN HER OWN MUSICAL TONGUE COME LITTLE DAUGHTER AND PLAY WHILE YOU WAIT SHE LED ME TO A ROOM THAT HAD PICTURES ON THE WALLS AND LEFT ME SURROUNDED BY TOYS BUT I COULD NOT PLAY
WHILE I CUT THEM OFF AND HOED UP THE ROOTS THE PLANTS TOWERED LUXURIANTLY ABOVE OUR HEADS MAKING THE TASK EXTREMELY PAINFUL
ONE DAY AS I WAS RETURNING FROM IT WITH MY EMPTY PAIL A TIDY BLACK EYED WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID I'M A CHEROKEE INDIAN THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE THREE DROVERS THAT SOLD THE BRUNNERS THEM LONG HORNED CATTLE THAT WAS DELIVERED THE OTHER DAY
ENCOURAGING MESSAGES REACHED HIM IN QUICK SUCCESSION FROM LONDON HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON HAD DRIVEN THE NATION MAD
THAT THE PRUDENCE OF THE LEADING WHIGS HAD WITH DIFFICULTY PREVENTED A SANGUINARY OUTBREAK ON THE DAY OF THE CORONATION AND THAT ALL THE GREAT LORDS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE EXCLUSION BILL WERE IMPATIENT TO RALLY ROUND HIM
WHEN GREY REPEATED WITH APPROBATION WHAT WILDMAN HAD SAID ABOUT RICHMOND AND RICHARD THE WELL READ AND THOUGHTFUL SCOT JUSTLY REMARKED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH
THERE WAS THEREFORE AT THE HAGUE AN EXTREME ANXIETY TO AVOID ALL THAT COULD GIVE HIM OFFENCE THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF WILLIAM WAS ALSO ON THIS OCCASION IDENTICAL WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS FATHER IN LAW
WHEN THE EARL REACHED HIS OWN PROVINCE HE FOUND THAT PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO REPEL HIM AT DUNSTAFFNAGE HE SENT HIS SECOND SON CHARLES ON SHORE TO CALL THE CAMPBELLS TO ARMS BUT CHARLES RETURNED WITH GLOOMY TIDINGS
OR AFRAID OF MOVING AND REFUSED EVEN TO SEE THE SON OF THEIR CHIEF FROM DUNSTAFFNAGE THE SMALL ARMAMENT PROCEEDED TO CAMPBELLTOWN NEAR THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA OF KINTYRE
AND ALL THE GOVERNORS AND HIS OFFICERS OF WAR
CALLED THE CAPTAINS AND OFFICERS OF THE POWER OF THE ASSYRIANS AND HE MUSTERED MEN FOR THE EXPEDITION AND THE KING COMMANDED HIM A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN ON FOOT AND TWELVE THOUSAND ARCHERS
WHO WERE OVER AGAINST THE FACE OF THE DESERT
WHEN THEY HAD LEFT OFF SPEAKING THAT HOLOFERNES BEING IN A VIOLENT PASSION
WENT THROUGH THE PLAINS BUT WHEN THEY CAME NEAR THE MOUNTAINS
O LORD GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH BEHOLD THEIR PRIDE AND LOOK ON OUR LOW CONDITION AND HAVE REGARD TO THE FACE OF THY SAINTS AND SHEW THAT THOU FORSAKEST NOT THEM THAT TRUST ON THEE
THE CHURCH THAT IS THE SYNAGOGUE OR PLACE WHERE THEY MET FOR PRAYER JUDITH CHAPTER SEVEN HOLOFERNES BESIEGETH BETHULIA
THAT THE INHABITANTS OF ALL THE CITIES BOTH PRINCES AND NOBLES AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE
ONLY SOME GOVERNMENT COULD OWN SUCH AN ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION AND IN THESE DISASTER FILLED TIMES WHEN MEN TAX THEIR INGENUITY TO BUILD INCREASINGLY POWERFUL AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT UNKNOWN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD SOME NATION COULD HAVE BEEN TESTING SUCH A FEARSOME MACHINE
WE MUST LOOK FOR THE ANIMAL IN QUESTION AMONG THOSE MARINE CREATURES ALREADY CATALOGED AND IN THIS EVENT I WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF A GIANT NARWHALE
MOREOVER THE SOLUTION IT PROPOSED ALLOWED FOR FREE PLAY OF THE IMAGINATION THE HUMAN MIND ENJOYS IMPRESSIVE VISIONS OF UNEARTHLY CREATURES NOW THEN THE SEA IS PRECISELY THEIR BEST MEDIUM
ACCORDINGLY THE WAGS CLAIMED THAT THIS SLIPPERY RASCAL HAD WAYLAID SOME PASSING TELEGRAM AND WAS MAKING THE MOST OF IT SO THE FRIGATE WAS EQUIPPED FOR A FAR OFF VOYAGE AND ARMED WITH FEARSOME FISHING GEAR BUT NOBODY KNEW WHERE TO STEER IT AND IMPATIENCE GREW UNTIL ON JUNE SECOND
CHAPTER THREE AS MASTER WISHES THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER
WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS WE'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE I TOLD CONSEIL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED AS COMFORTABLE AS A HERMIT CRAB INSIDE THE SHELL OF A WHELK
IT HUGGED THIS SAND COVERED STRIP OF LAND WHERE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS ACCLAIMED US ONE MORE TIME THE ESCORT OF BOATS AND TENDERS STILL FOLLOWED THE FRIGATE AND ONLY LEFT US WHEN WE CAME ABREAST OF THE LIGHTSHIP WHOSE TWO SIGNAL LIGHTS MARK THE ENTRANCE OF THE NARROWS TO UPPER NEW YORK BAY
IF MASTER'S EYES WOULD KINDLY STOP BULGING MASTER WILL SEE FARTHER BUT WHAT A WASTE OF ENERGY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHANGE COURSE AND RACE AFTER THE ANIMAL SIGHTED ONLY TO FIND AN ORDINARY BALEEN WHALE
NOBODY ATE NOBODY SLEPT TWENTY TIMES A DAY SOME ERROR IN PERCEPTION OR THE OPTICAL ILLUSIONS OF SOME SAILOR PERCHED IN THE CROSSTREES WOULD CAUSE INTOLERABLE ANGUISH AND THIS EMOTION REPEATED TWENTY TIMES OVER
THIS REACTION MOUNTED UPWARD FROM THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP FROM THE QUARTERS OF THE BUNKER HANDS TO THE MESSROOM OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND FOR CERTAIN IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT'S CHARACTERISTIC STUBBORNNESS THE FRIGATE WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE PUT BACK TO THAT CAPE IN THE SOUTH
WHILE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HEAVED TO ITS LONGBOATS RADIATED IN EVERY DIRECTION AROUND IT AND DIDN'T LEAVE A SINGLE POINT OF THE SEA UNEXPLORED BUT THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER FOURTH ARRIVED WITH THIS UNDERWATER MYSTERY STILL UNSOLVED
HUGE CLOUDS COVERED THE MOON'S DISK THEN IN ITS FIRST QUARTER THE SEA UNDULATED PLACIDLY BENEATH THE FRIGATE'S STEMPOST JUST THEN I WAS IN THE BOW LEANING OVER THE STARBOARD RAIL CONSEIL STATIONED BESIDE ME STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD
ROOSTING IN THE SHROUDS THE CREW EXAMINED THE HORIZON WHICH SHRANK AND DARKENED LITTLE BY LITTLE OFFICERS WERE PROBING THE INCREASING GLOOM WITH THEIR NIGHT GLASSES SOMETIMES THE MURKY OCEAN SPARKLED BENEATH MOONBEAMS THAT DARTED BETWEEN THE FRINGES OF TWO CLOUDS
TO BE SURE CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY I DO THINK THEY'LL HAVE FUN AT MASTER'S EXPENSE AND MUST IT BE SAID IT MUST BE SAID CONSEIL WELL THEN IT WILL SERVE MASTER RIGHT
THE PERSONAL WITNESS TO THE STRANGER'S VISIT PRONOUNCED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO BE NOTHING BETTER THAN A BAILIFF SUCH AS SATCHELL HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF DENYING MISTER CASSON'S TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD SEEN THE STRANGER NEVERTHELESS
YOU'RE ABOUT AS NEAR THE RIGHT LANGUAGE AS A PIG'S SQUEAKING IS LIKE A TUNE PLAYED ON A KEY BUGLE WELL I DON'T KNOW
AYE AYE MAN SAID BARTLE WITH A TONE OF SARCASTIC CONSOLATION YOU TALK THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR YOU WHEN MIKE HOLDSWORTH'S GOAT SAYS BA A A IT'S ALL RIGHT IT UD BE UNNATURAL FOR IT TO MAKE ANY OTHER NOISE
THE REST OF THE PARTY BEING LOAMSNIRE MEN
AND WISELY FELL BACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED IN A SINGLE EVENING WAS RENEWED IN THE CHURCHYARD BEFORE SERVICE THE NEXT DAY WITH THE FRESH INTEREST CONFERRED ON ALL NEWS WHEN THERE IS A FRESH PERSON TO HEAR IT
IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS
THANK YOU I WILL DO SO I WANT TO CONSULT HIM ABOUT A LITTLE MATTER BUT YOU ARE QUITE AS MUCH CONCERNED IN IT IF NOT MORE I MUST HAVE YOUR OPINION TOO HETTY RUN AND TELL YOUR UNCLE TO COME IN
WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MISTER DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
AND LOSE HALF OF EM WI THE MEASLES AND THERE'S THE FETCHING AND CARRYING AS UD BE WELLY HALF A DAY'S WORK FOR A MAN AN HOSS THAT'S TO BE TOOK OUT O THE PROFITS I RECKON BUT THERE'S FOLKS UD HOLD A SIEVE UNDER THE PUMP
AND KEEPING EM WITH THEIR HANDS ON THEIR HIPS LISTENING TO ALL MANNER O GOSSIP WHEN THEY SHOULD BE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES A SCOURING IF WE'RE TO GO TO RUIN IT SHANNA BE WI HAVING OUR BACK KITCHEN TURNED INTO A PUBLIC WELL POYSER
WI THE CELLAR FULL O WATER AND FROGS AND TOADS HOPPIN UP THE STEPS BY DOZENS AND THE FLOORS ROTTEN AND THE RATS AND MICE GNAWING EVERY BIT O CHEESE AND RUNNIN OVER OUR HEADS AS WE LIE BED TILL WE EXPECT EM TO EAT US UP ALIVE
FOR AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTS OF STUNNED SURPRISE HE HAD GOT UP AND WAVING HIS HAND TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE HAD WALKED OUT TOWARDS HIS PONY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET AWAY IMMEDIATELY FOR JOHN WAS WALKING THE PONY UP AND DOWN THE YARD
AND WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CAUSEWAY WHEN HIS MASTER BECKONED YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR AND YOU MAY GO SPINNIN UNDERHAND WAYS O DOING US A MISCHIEF FOR YOU'VE GOT OLD HARRY TO YOUR FRIEND THOUGH NOBODY ELSE IS
AS SPEAKS MY MIND THERE'S PLENTY O THE SAME WAY O THINKING THIS PARISH
AND THERE'S LITTLE LIKELIHOOD FOR IT SEEMS AS IF THEM AS AREN'T WANTED HERE ARE TH
BUT KEEPING NEAR THE DOOR I'M SURE I SHOULD LIKE MY BREAKFAST BETTER IF I KNEW THE BUTTER AND CREAM CAME FROM THIS DAIRY THANK YOU THAT REALLY IS A PLEASANT SIGHT UNFORTUNATELY MY SLIGHT TENDENCY TO RHEUMATISM MAKES ME AFRAID OF DAMP
MISTER POYSER HAD JUST ENTERED IN SHIRT SLEEVES AND OPEN WAISTCOAT WITH A FACE A SHADE REDDER THAN USUAL FROM THE EXERTION OF PITCHING AS HE STOOD RED ROTUND AND RADIANT
I THINK SHE HAS NOT A GOOD METHOD AS YOU HAVE INDEED SIR I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SAID MISSUS POYSER IN A HARD VOICE ROLLING AND UNROLLING HER KNITTING AND LOOKING ICILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SHE CONTINUED TO STAND OPPOSITE THE SQUIRE
YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND MISTER THURLE AN EXCELLENT NEIGHBOUR I ASSURE YOU SUCH A ONE AS YOU WILL FEEL GLAD TO HAVE ACCOMMODATED BY THE LITTLE PLAN I'M GOING TO MENTION ESPECIALLY AS I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT AS MUCH TO YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE AS HIS
I KNOW THERE'S THEM AS IS BORN T OWN THE LAND AND THEM AS IS BORN TO SWEAT ON'T HERE MISSUS POYSER PAUSED TO GASP A LITTLE AND I KNOW IT'S CHRISTENED FOLKS'S DUTY TO SUBMIT TO THEIR BETTERS AS FUR AS FLESH AND
WITH TWO BEDS IN IT ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ
SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR IT WAS MISTER IRWINE ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MISTER IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND I'M LATE ADAM
IT IS NOT ONLY YOU SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW CREATURES SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER
WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
HER DANCING ATTENDANCE UPON HIM PERPETUALLY RELATED TO THAT AND THAT ALONE HER FACE WAS MORE FLUSHED THAN IT HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW HE SPOKE QUIETLY NOW QUITE IN AN EQUAL TONE OF REASONING IT WAS HIS WAY WHEN THE ILL TEMPER WAS UPON HIM
I RECEIVED THESE FROM YOU A MONTH AGO SHE SAID THEY CAME BY POST AND NEVER HAD THE GRACE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM HE RETURNED IN A SORT OF MOCK REPROACHFUL TONE FORTY POUNDS THAT WAS THE AMOUNT WAS IT NOT I BELIEVE SO
ALLOW ME TO RETURN THEM TO YOU COUNT THEM RETURN THEM TO ME FOR WHAT INQUIRED SIR FRANCIS IN AMAZEMENT I HAVE NO LONGER ANYTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH YOU IN ANY WAY DO NOT MAKE MY ARM ACHE HOLDING OUT THESE NOTES TO YOU SO LONG TAKE THEM
HE TOOK OUT HIS POCKET BOOK AND PLACED THE BANK NOTES WITHIN IT YOUR CLOTHES
YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ORDER PIERRE TO TAKE AWAY THIS AFTERNOON AND NOW SIR FRANCIS I BELIEVE THAT IS ALL WE WILL PART TO REMAIN MORTAL ENEMIES FROM HENCEFORTH IS THAT TO BE IT TO BE STRANGERS SHE REPLIED CORRECTING HIM
EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICE AND OLD MISTER DILL AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE LAUGHED WHEN HE TOLD IT THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERRUPTED BY THE CRYING OF ARCHIBALD AND IN TURNING TO THE LAWN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE AWOKE
ALAS IT WAS THE ACTUAL CRYING OF HER OWN CHILD WHICH AWOKE HER THIS LAST CHILD THE ILL FATED LITTLE BEING IN THE CRADLE BESIDE HER
THIS RIDGE LED US ON TO AN ICEWAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH A FORMATION WHICH WAS DUE TO THE PRESSURE HAVING CEASED BEFORE THE WAVE HAD BEEN FORCED TO BREAK AND FORM HUMMOCKS
AND FRETTING AT THE PERSISTENTLY THICK WEATHER ONE OF US SUDDENLY CALLED OUT HULLO LOOK THERE A WILD DARK SUMMIT ROSE HIGH OUT OF THE MASS OF FOG TO THE EAST SOUTH EAST IT WAS NOT FAR AWAY
WHAT I LIKED LEAST ABOUT THIS FEELING ONE'S WAY FORWARD IN THE DARK WAS THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT VERY DIFFICULT INDEED TO RECOGNIZE THE GROUND AGAIN ON THE WAY BACK BUT WITH THIS GLACIER LYING STRAIGHT ACROSS OUR LINE OF ROUTE
WE WERE AT HELL'S GATE BJAALAND TOOK AN EXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPH HERE WHICH GIVES A VERY GOOD IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTIES THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY PRESENTED IN THE FOREGROUND
HAD NOW BROKEN LOOSE AGAIN AND THE NORTH EASTER WAS DOING ALL IT COULD
POSSIBLY BUT DOWN NO THAT DID NOT AGREE WITH MY RECKONING SO FAR THE INCLINE HAD NOT BEEN SO GREAT AS TO CAUSE UNEASINESS BUT IF IT SERIOUSLY BEGAN TO GO DOWNHILL WE SHOULD HAVE TO STOP AND CAMP
BY TWISTING HIS SLEDGE THE OTHERS WHO WERE FOLLOWING STOPPED WHEN THEY CAME UP TO HIM WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAIRLY STEEP DESCENT WHAT THERE MIGHT BE BELOW WAS NOT EASY TO DECIDE NOR WOULD WE TRY TO FIND OUT IN THAT WEATHER
TURNING OUT OF ONE'S GOOD WARM SLEEPING BAG AND STANDING OUTSIDE FOR SOME TIME IN THIN CLOTHES WATCHING THE WEATHER WE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT A GLEAM LIKE THIS A CLEARING IN THE WEATHER MIGHT COME SUDDENLY AND THEN ONE HAD TO BE ON THE SPOT
AND WAITED FOR DECENTLY CLEAR WEATHER SO THAT WE MIGHT SURVEY THE GROUND AT OUR EASE AND CHOOSE THE BEST WAY GOING FORWARD WITHOUT AN IDEA OF WHAT THE GROUND WAS LIKE WAS NOT VERY PLEASANT
ARE DOUBTLESS OFFSHOOTS FROM ANCIENT FOLK LORE SONGS AND HAVE DESCENDED TO US THROUGH MANY CENTURIES THE CONNECTION OF MOTHER GOOSE WITH THE RHYMES WHICH BEAR HER NAME IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AND IN FACT THREE COUNTRIES CLAIM HER FOR THEIR OWN
WHICH CONTAINED MANY OF THE IDENTICAL PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN TO US BUT THE NAME OF MOTHER GOOSE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT THEN KNOWN IN THIS EDITION WERE THE RHYMES OF LITTLE JACK HOMER OLD KING COLE MISTRESS MARY SING A SONG O SIXPENCE
AND LITTLE BOY BLUE IN SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN CHARLES PERRAULT PUBLISHED IN FRANCE
AMERICA BASES HER CLAIM TO MOTHER GOOSE UPON THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT MADE BY THE LATE JOHN FLEET ELIOT A DESCENDANT OF THOMAS FLEET THE PRINTER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THERE LIVED IN BOSTON A LADY NAMED ELIZA GOOSE
TRIED WHAT RIDICULE COULD EFFECT AND ACTUALLY PRINTED A BOOK UNDER THE TITLE SONGS OF THE NURSERY OR MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES FOR CHILDREN ON THE TITLE PAGE WAS THE PICTURE OF A GOOSE WITH A VERY LONG NECK AND A MOUTH WIDE OPEN AND BELOW THIS
BUT THE REST OF THE STORY IS UNSUPPORTED BY ANY EVIDENCE WHATEVER IN FACT ALL THAT MISTER ELIOT KNEW OF IT WAS THE STATEMENT OF THE LATE EDWARD A CROWNINSHIELD OF BOSTON THAT HE HAD SEEN FLEET'S EDITION IN THE LIBRARY OF THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY
INDEED AS MISTER WILLIAM H WHITMORE POINTS OUT IN HIS CLEVER MONOGRAPH UPON MOTHER GOOSE ALBANY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN SEVENTEEN NINETEEN
IS OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS BOSTON'S THERE LIVED IN A TOWN IN SUSSEX ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR AN OLD WOMAN NAMED MARTHA GOOCH SHE WAS A CAPITAL NURSE AND IN GREAT DEMAND TO CARE FOR NEWLY BORN BABIES THEREFORE
SOME OF THE EARLIER VERSES HAVE BECOME ENTIRELY OBSOLETE AND IT IS WELL THEY HAVE FOR MANY WERE CRUDE AND SILLY AND OTHERS WERE COARSE IT IS SIMPLY A RESULT OF THE GREATER REFINEMENT OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
LEAVING THE IMAGINATION TO WEAVE IN THE DETAILS OF THE STORY PERHAPS THEREIN MAY LIE PART OF THEIR CHARM BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I HAVE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN MIGHT LIKE THE STORIES TOLD AT GREATER LENGTH THAT THEY MAY DWELL THE LONGER UPON THEIR FAVORITE HEROES AND HEROINES
AND ONE OF THESE FLOCKS USED TO BE CARED FOR BY A POOR WOMAN WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF AND HER LITTLE GIRL BY THIS MEANS THEY LIVED IN A SMALL COTTAGE NESTLED AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE HILLS AND EACH MORNING THE MOTHER TOOK HER CROOK
AND STARTED OUT WITH HER SHEEP THAT THEY MIGHT FEED UPON THE TENDER JUICY GRASSES WITH WHICH THE HILLS ABOUNDED THE LITTLE GIRL USUALLY ACCOMPANIED HER MOTHER AND SAT BY HER SIDE
VERY SOON I SHALL SEE THE SHEEP COMING BACK BUT TIME PASSED AWAY AND STILL THE ERRANT FLOCK FAILED TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE SOON THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS BEGAN TO NOD
AND BO PEEP HAD FULLY DECIDED TO SEEK FOR THE TAILS AND FIND THEM BEFORE SHE RELATED THE STORY OF THEIR LOSS TO ANYONE EACH DAY FOR MANY DAYS AFTER THAT LITTLE BO PEEP WANDERED ABOUT THE HILLS SEEKING THE TAILS OF HER SHEEP
WHY SHE EXCLAIMED SMILING AGAIN I CAN SEW THEM ON OF COURSE THEN SHE HEAVED A SIGH AND WIPED HER EYE AND RAN O'ER HILL AND DALE OH AND TRIED WHAT SHE COULD AS A SHEPHERDESS SHOULD TO TACK TO EACH SHEEP ITS TAIL OH
A PARTIALLY OPENED DOOR GAVE A GLIMPSE OF THE CROWDED HALL AND ADMITTED A VAST UNEVEN TUMULT A HAMMERING CLAPPING AND SHOUTING THAT DIED AWAY AND BEGAN AGAIN AND ROSE TO A THUNDEROUS PITCH
MASSED IN THE INAUDIBLE IT IS NOW OR NEVER THE COUNCIL IS ROCKING THEY CANNOT TRUST EVEN THEIR DRILLED MEN HEAR THE PEOPLE CALLING TO YOU GRAHAM'S MIND WAS LIKE A NIGHT OF MOON AND SWIFT CLOUDS
THE HALL WAS A VAST AND INTRICATE SPACE GALLERIES BALCONIES BROAD SPACES OF AMPHITHEATRAL STEPS AND GREAT ARCHWAYS FAR AWAY HIGH UP SEEMED THE MOUTH OF A HUGE PASSAGE FULL OF STRUGGLING HUMANITY
MOST OF THE FACES WERE FLUSHED BUT MANY WERE GHASTLY WHITE AND DISEASE WAS THERE AND MANY A HAND THAT WAVED TO HIM WAS GAUNT AND LEAN MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NEW AGE STRANGE AND INCREDIBLE MEETING AS THE BROAD STREAM PASSED BEFORE HIM TO THE RIGHT
ATTENDANTS INTERVENED AND EVER AND AGAIN BLOTTED OUT THE SIGHT OF THE MULTITUDE TO THE LEFT BEFORE HIM WENT THE BACKS OF THE GUARDS IN BLACK THREE AND THREE AND THREE HE WAS MARCHED ALONG A LITTLE RAILED WAY AND CROSSED ABOVE THE ARCHWAY
THE ROAD WAS A LONG AND VERY BROAD AND HIGH TUNNEL ALONG WHICH BIG WHEELED MACHINES DROVE NOISELESSLY AND SWIFTLY HERE TOO THE DISTINCTIVE BLUE OF THE LABOUR DEPARTMENT WAS IN ABUNDANCE THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE DOUBLE TRACKS
BUT WHEREVER THERE WAS WORK IT WAS BEING DONE BY SLOW MOVING WORKERS IN BLUE CANVAS THE ONLY PEOPLE NOT IN BLUE CANVAS WERE THE OVERLOOKERS OF THE WORK PLACES AND THE ORANGE CLAD LABOUR POLICE AND FRESH FROM THE FLUSHED FACES OF THE DANCING HALLS
THEY EMERGED FROM THESE WANDERINGS AND STOOD BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE OF THE PLATFORMS AGAIN THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE REMOTE HOOTING AND YELPING OF THE MACHINES OF ONE OF THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICES
THAT MEN YELLED TO ONE ANOTHER THAT WOMEN TOOK UP SCREAMING THAT WAS PASSING LIKE THE FIRST BREEZE OF A THUNDERSTORM CHILL AND SUDDEN THROUGH THE CITY WAS THIS OSTROG HAS ORDERED THE BLACK POLICE TO LONDON THE BLACK POLICE ARE COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA THE BLACK POLICE THE BLACK POLICE
HAD NOT SOMEONE IN THE WIND VANE OFFICES LEARNT HE SAID A GIRL A GIRL NOT HE SAID A GIRL HE DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS WHO CAME OUT FROM THE COUNCIL HOUSE CRYING ALOUD AND TOLD THE MEN AT WORK AMONG THE RUINS
WHICH SO STARTLED HIM THAT IN HIS CONFUSION HE WOUNDED HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN ARROW HEEDLESS OF HIS WOUND HIS WHOLE THOUGHT NOW WAS TO REPAIR THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE AND HE POURED THE BALMY DROPS OF JOY OVER ALL HER SILKEN RINGLETS
AND AFTER REPOSE AND THE REFRESHMENT OF THE BATH SEATED HERSELF IN THE ALCOVE WHERE A TABLE IMMEDIATELY PRESENTED ITSELF WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE AID FROM WAITERS OR SERVANTS AND COVERED WITH THE GREATEST DELICACIES OF FOOD AND THE MOST NECTAREOUS WINES
AND SAY MY MISTRESS VENUS DESIRES YOU TO SEND HER A LITTLE OF YOUR BEAUTY FOR IN TENDING HER SICK SON SHE HAS LOST SOME OF HER OWN BE NOT TOO LONG ON YOUR ERRAND FOR I MUST PAINT MYSELF WITH IT TO APPEAR AT THE CIRCLE OF THE GODS AND GODDESSES THIS EVENING
WHAT SAID SHE SHALL I THE CARRIER OF THIS DIVINE BEAUTY NOT TAKE THE LEAST BIT TO PUT ON MY CHEEKS TO APPEAR TO MORE ADVANTAGE IN THE EYES OF MY BELOVED HUSBAND SO SHE CAREFULLY OPENED THE BOX BUT FOUND NOTHING THERE OF ANY BEAUTY AT ALL
BUT AN INFERNAL AND TRULY STYGIAN SLEEP WHICH BEING THUS SET FREE FROM ITS PRISON TOOK POSSESSION OF HER AND SHE FELL DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE ROAD A SLEEPY CORPSE WITHOUT SENSE OR MOTION BUT CUPID BEING NOW RECOVERED FROM HIS WOUND
SOON MADE HER CONFESS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO FILL HER BOSOM WITH DARK SUSPICIONS CALL TO MIND THEY SAID
STARTLED WITH WHICH HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON HER THEN WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD HE SPREAD HIS WHITE WINGS AND FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW PSYCHE IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO FOLLOW HIM FELL FROM THE WINDOW TO THE GROUND
WHILE SHE SAT DESPAIRING CUPID STIRRED UP THE LITTLE ANT A NATIVE OF THE FIELDS TO TAKE COMPASSION ON HER THE LEADER OF THE ANT HILL FOLLOWED BY WHOLE HOSTS OF HIS SIX LEGGED SUBJECTS
FOR SEE SHE WALKS THE EARTH LOVE'S OWN HIS WEDDED BRIDE BY HOLIEST VOW PLEDGED IN OLYMPUS AND MADE KNOWN TO MORTALS BY THE TYPE WHICH NOW HANGS GLITTERING ON HER SNOWY BROW
ENTER WITH ME MY HOUSE AND REFRESH YOURSELVES WITH WHATEVER YOUR SISTER HAS TO OFFER THEN TAKING THEIR HANDS SHE LED THEM INTO HER GOLDEN PALACE AND COMMITTED THEM TO THE CARE OF HER NUMEROUS TRAIN OF ATTENDANT VOICES TO REFRESH THEM IN HER BATHS
PSYCHE OBEDIENTLY WENT TO THE RIVERSIDE PREPARED TO DO HER BEST TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND BUT THE RIVER GOD INSPIRED THE REEDS WITH HARMONIOUS MURMURS WHICH SEEMED TO SAY O MAIDEN SEVERELY TRIED TEMPT NOT THE DANGEROUS FLOOD
HEAVENLY MARRIAGES ARE MADE IN BURGUNDY BETWEEN RED AND WHITE WINES OF BOTH COTES
SUCH NOTABLES AS SAINTE MAURE
AND ANY DRY RED WINE MOST COMMONLY CLARET IS A FIT DRINK FOR THE HUNDREDS OF OTHER FINE FRENCH CHEESES EVERY COUNTRY HAS SUCH HAPPY MARRIAGES AN ITALIAN STANDARD BEING PROVOLONE AND CHIANTI
ONLY THE ENGLISH SEEM TO HAVE A FORTISSIMO TASTE IN THE GO WITH WINES ACCORDING TO THESE MATCHES REGISTERED BY ANDRE SIMON IN THE ART OF GOOD LIVING RED CHESHIRE WITH LIGHT TAWNY PORT WHITE CHESHIRE
AND FROM THE CAROLINAS TO HUDSON'S BAY WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO GREAT FAMILIES OF TRIBES DISTINGUISHED BY A RADICAL DIFFERENCE OF LANGUAGE A PART OF VIRGINIA AND OF PENNSYLVANIA NEW JERSEY SOUTHEASTERN NEW YORK NEW ENGLAND
OR PROWLING WARRIOR WE HAVE SAID THAT THIS GROUP OF TRIBES WAS RELATIVELY VERY POPULOUS YET IT IS MORE THAN DOUBTFUL WHETHER ALL OF THEM UNITED HAD UNION BEEN POSSIBLE COULD HAVE MUSTERED EIGHT THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN TO SPEAK FURTHER OF THEM IS NEEDLESS
AND THE WHOLE OF NEW BRUNSWICK WERE OCCUPIED
TO WHOM AGRICULTURE WAS UNKNOWN THOUGH THE SEA PROLIFIC OF FISH LOBSTERS AND SEALS GREATLY LIGHTENED THEIR MISERIES
THAT PROVIDENCE IS CLEAR AS THE SUN AT NOON MEANWHILE LET THOSE WHO HAVE PREVAILED YIELD DUE HONOR TO THE DEFEATED THEIR VIRTUES SHINE AMIDST THE RUBBISH OF ERROR LIKE DIAMONDS AND GOLD IN THE GRAVEL OF THE TORRENT
I HEARD MANY THINGS IN HELL HOW THEN AM I MAD HEARKEN AND OBSERVE HOW HEALTHILY HOW CALMLY I CAN TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW FIRST THE IDEA ENTERED MY BRAIN BUT ONCE CONCEIVED
IT HAUNTED ME DAY AND NIGHT OBJECT THERE WAS NONE PASSION THERE WAS NONE I LOVED THE OLD MAN HE HAD NEVER WRONGED ME HE HAD NEVER GIVEN ME INSULT FOR HIS GOLD I HAD NO DESIRE I THINK IT WAS HIS EYE
SO YOU SEE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY PROFOUND OLD MAN INDEED TO SUSPECT THAT EVERY NIGHT JUST AT TWELVE I LOOKED IN UPON HIM WHILE HE SLEPT UPON THE EIGHTH NIGHT I WAS MORE THAN USUALLY CAUTIOUS IN OPENING THE DOOR
BUT EVEN YET I REFRAINED AND KEPT STILL I SCARCELY BREATHED I HELD THE LANTERN MOTIONLESS I TRIED HOW STEADILY I COULD MAINTAIN THE RAY
WITH A LOUD YELL I THREW OPEN THE LANTERN AND LEAPED INTO THE ROOM HE SHRIEKED ONCE ONCE ONLY IN AN INSTANT I DRAGGED HIM TO THE FLOOR
HAD BEEN DEPUTED TO SEARCH THE PREMISES I SMILED FOR WHAT HAD I TO FEAR I BADE THE GENTLEMEN WELCOME THE SHRIEK I SAID WAS MY OWN IN A DREAM THE OLD MAN I MENTIONED WAS ABSENT IN THE COUNTRY
AND BECAME MORE DISTINCT I TALKED MORE FREELY TO GET RID OF THE FEELING BUT IT CONTINUED AND GAINED DEFINITENESS UNTIL AT LENGTH I FOUND THAT THE NOISE WAS NOT WITHIN MY EARS NO DOUBT I NOW GREW VERY PALE BUT I TALKED MORE FLUENTLY
WHO PRESENTED HER MIRROR TO THE TEMPLE TO BE USED FOR BELL METAL BUT AFTERWARDS SHE MUCH REGRETTED HER MIRROR SHE REMEMBERED THINGS THAT HER MOTHER HAD TOLD HER ABOUT IT AND SHE REMEMBERED THAT IT HAD BELONGED NOT ONLY TO HER MOTHER BUT TO HER MOTHER'S MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND SHE REMEMBERED SOME HAPPY SMILES WHICH IT HAD REFLECTED
OF COURSE EVERYBODY HEARD OF THE MATTER AND EVERYBODY SOON KNEW WHOSE MIRROR IT WAS THAT WOULD NOT MELT AND BECAUSE OF THIS PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF HER SECRET FAULT THE POOR WOMAN BECAME VERY MUCH ASHAMED AND VERY ANGRY AND AS SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE SHAME SHE DROWNED HERSELF
THE PEOPLE WHOM YOU SAW IN THE NEXT ROOM ARE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS VILLAGE
AND THIS TIME ITS AGED OCCUPANT INVITED HIM TO ENTER WHEN HE HAD DONE SO THE HERMIT HUMBLY BOWED DOWN BEFORE HIM EXCLAIMING AH I AM ASHAMED I AM VERY MUCH ASHAMED I AM EXCEEDINGLY ASHAMED
BUT AS HE HAD NEVER SOUGHT DISTINCTION FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALONE AND AS HIS HEART REMAINED TRUE TO HIS FORMER LORD HE PREFERRED TO GIVE UP THE WORLD SO HE CUT OFF HIS HAIR AND BECAME A TRAVELING PRIEST TAKING THE BUDDHIST NAME OF KWAIRYO
AND AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENT OBSERVATION SAID TO HIM IN A TONE OF GREAT SURPRISE WHAT KIND OF A MAN CAN YOU BE GOOD SIR THAT YOU DARE TO LIE DOWN ALONE IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THERE ARE HAUNTERS ABOUT HERE MANY OF THEM ARE YOU NOT AFRAID OF HAIRY THINGS
AS FOR LONESOME PLACES I LIKE THEM THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR MEDITATION I AM ACCUSTOMED TO SLEEPING IN THE OPEN AIR AND I HAVE LEARNED NEVER TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT MY LIFE
AND I MUST ASSURE YOU SIR THAT IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO SLEEP HERE THEREFORE ALTHOUGH MY HOUSE IS ONLY A WRETCHED THATCHED HUT LET ME BEG OF YOU TO COME HOME WITH ME AT ONCE IN THE WAY OF FOOD I HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER YOU BUT THERE IS A ROOF AT LEAST AND YOU CAN SLEEP UNDER IT WITHOUT RISK
THOUGH NOW LIVING AS YOU FIND ME I WAS ONCE A PERSON OF SOME DISTINCTION MY STORY IS THE STORY OF A RUINED LIFE RUINED BY MY OWN FAULT I USED TO BE IN THE SERVICE OF A DAIMYO AND MY RANK IN THAT SERVICE WAS NOT INCONSIDERABLE
FOR ONE INSTANT HE STOOD BEWILDERED IMAGINING A CRIME BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS NO BLOOD AND THAT THE HEADLESS NECKS DID NOT LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CUT THEN HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
SINCE MY BODY HAS BEEN MOVED TO REJOIN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN I MUST DIE AND ALL THROUGH THE WORK OF THAT PRIEST
BUT ITS TEETH STILL HELD THE SLEEVE AND FOR ALL HIS GREAT STRENGTH KWAIRYO COULD NOT FORCE OPEN THE JAWS WITH THE HEAD STILL HANGING TO HIS SLEEVE HE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND THERE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE OTHER FOUR ROKURO KUBI SQUATTING TOGETHER
WITH THEIR BRUISED AND BLEEDING HEADS REUNITED TO THEIR BODIES BUT WHEN THEY PERCEIVED HIM AT THE BACK DOOR ALL SCREAMED THE PRIEST THE PRIEST AND FLED THROUGH THE OTHER DOORWAY OUT INTO THE WOODS EASTWARD THE SKY WAS BRIGHTENING DAY WAS ABOUT TO DAWN
KATY IS HE GONE NO MA'AM REPLIED THE DISTURBED DAMSEL WITH GREAT BITTERNESS HE IS NOT YET GONE BUT HE MAY GO AS SOON AS HE PLEASES NOW FOR THE WORST IS DONE
AND THOSE HE HAS ON ARE NONE OF THE BEST I CAN TELL YOU HOW EXCLAIMED THE OTHER ASTONISHED COULD ANYONE HAVE THE HEART TO PLUNDER A MAN IN SUCH DISTRESS HEARTS REPEATED KATY CATCHING HER BREATH MEN LIKE THEM HAVE NO BOWELS AT ALL PLUNDER AND DISTRESS INDEED
HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE
THE TONGUE IS WELL AND THE PULSE BEGINS TO LOWER AGAIN AH THE BLEEDING DID YOU GOOD PHLEBOTOMY IS A SOVEREIGN SPECIFIC FOR SOUTHERN CONSTITUTIONS
THE ANGEL I SAW MAY BE A DAUGHTER A SISTER OR A NIECE BUT NEVER AN AUNT HUSH GEORGE HUSH YOUR TALKING HAS BROUGHT YOUR PULSE UP AGAIN YOU MUST OBSERVE QUIET AND PREPARE FOR A MEETING WITH YOUR OWN SISTER WHO WILL BE HERE WITHIN AN HOUR WHAT ISABELLA AND WHO SENT FOR HER
WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
YES SAID THE OTHER SENDING THE SECOND SLIPPER AFTER THE FIRST AND THIS MAJOR DUNWOODIE NEVER OVERLOOKS AN ADVANTAGE I THINK IF WE HAD THE THING TO DO OVER AGAIN CONTINUED THE COLONEL RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET WE MIGHT ALTER THE CASE VERY MATERIALLY THOUGH THE CHIEF THING THE REBELS HAVE NOW TO BOAST OF IS MY CAPTURE
A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
JEFF THE INQUISITIVE BY GENERAL RUSH C HAWKINS AMONG THE GUNBOATS DOING DUTY ON THE INLAND WATERS OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
HE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE SHIP HE HAD NO FAVORITES BUT WAS HAIL FELLOW WELL MET WITH ALL HE DEVELOPED ALL THE PLAYFUL QUALITIES OF A PUPPY AND REASONED OUT A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS IN HIS OWN WAY
POSSIBLY HOWEVER RATHER MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE AVERAGE CANINE PET THE FOURTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS A GALA DAY AT ROANOKE ISLAND
WAS MADE MORE GLORIOUS BY THE EXCHANGE OF CAMP HOSPITALITIES AND AN INDULGENCE IN SUCH SIMPLE HILARITY AS THE OCCASION SEEMED TO REQUIRE BUT JEFF WAS NOT FORGOTTEN EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS BATHED AND SCRUBBED
SHE MADE HER BACK QUITE ACHE WITH WALKING ALL NIGHT ROUND HER YOUNG CHARGES FOR FEAR ANY HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND IN THE MORNING SAYS SHE TO HERSELF TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
I SEE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS I KNOW NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE MORE OH CATERPILLAR IT IS BECAUSE YOU CRAWL BECAUSE YOU NEVER GET BEYOND YOUR CABBAGE LEAF THAT YOU CALL ANY THING IMPOSSIBLE
FOR AS THE FIRST WONDER WAS POSSIBLE THE SECOND MIGHT BE SO TOO TEACH ME YOUR LESSON LARK SHE WOULD SAY AND THE LARK SANG TO HER OF THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH BELOW AND OF THE HEAVEN ABOVE
TREES BUT TREES THERE WERE IN PLENTY THEY STOOD EVERYWHERE FROM COAST TO COAST THEY SAW THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN ALL THE RIVERS AND LAKES AND STRETCHED THEIR MIGHTY BOUGHS UP TOWARDS HEAVEN
ONE DAY THE BEAR CAME TRUDGING ALONG AND LAY DOWN AT FULL BREADTH UNDER A GREAT OAK TREE ARE YOU THERE AGAIN YOU ROBBER SAID THE OAK AND SHOOK A LOT OF WITHERED LEAVES DOWN OVER HIM YOU SHOULD NOT SQUANDER YOUR LEAVES MY OLD FRIEND
IT WAS IN A LAND DOWN TOWARDS THE SOUTH THERE I TOOK A NAP UNDER THE BEECH TREES THEY ARE TALL SLIM TREES NOT CROOKED OLD THINGS LIKE YOU AND THEIR TOPS ARE SO DENSE THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP THROUGH THEM
THEY KILLED MY WIFE AND ONE OF MY BROTHERS AND I MUST SEE ABOUT FINDING A PLACE WHERE I CAN LIVE IN PEACE THERE IS SCARCELY A SPOT LEFT WHERE A SELF RESPECTING BEAR CAN STAY GOODBYE YOU OLD GNARLED OAK TREES
AND OF GOOD FAMILY BESIDES THE BEECHES LAUGHED WITH THEIR LITTLE TINY GREEN LEAVES BUT SAID NOTHING SHALL I BEND MY BRANCHES A LITTLE ASIDE SO THAT THE SUN CAN SHINE BETTER ON YOU THE OLD TREE ASKED POLITELY
THE BEECHES ONLY LAUGHED AND WENT ON GROWING AT LAST THEY CLOSED TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE OAK'S HEAD AND THEN HE DIED THAT WAS A HORRID THING TO DO
HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO HOLD OUT WHEN A REGULAR STORM COMES I ASSURE YOU THE WIND GIVES ONE'S HEAD A GOOD SHAKING MY OLD BOUGHS HAVE CREAKED MANY A TIME AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BECOME OF THE FLIMSY FINERY THAT YOU STICK UP IN THE AIR
WHAT AN OLD STUPID I WAS BEFORE THAT WE OAK TREES WERE LORDS IN THE LAND AND NOW EVERY YEAR I SEE MY BROTHERS AROUND ME PERISHING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOU IT WILL SOON BE ALL OVER WITH ME
OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
HAD ALREADY RISEN TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND GAVE SUFFICIENT WARNING OF THEIR FUTURE ATTEMPTS UPON THAT ORDER THEY MUTTERED SOMEWHAT OF THEIR REGRET THAT THEY SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SAVE THE KINGDOM ALONE
IF HE EXERTED THE VIGOR AND DISPLAYED THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH THE DARING USURPATIONS OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD SHRINK BEFORE HIM LORD DIGBY A MAN OF FINE PARTS BUT FULL OF LEVITY AND HURRIED ON BY PRECIPITATE PASSIONS
MESSENGERS WERE EMPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND ARREST THEM THEIR TRUNKS CHAMBERS AND STUDIES WERE SEALED AND LOCKED THE HOUSE VOTED ALL THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BE BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE
BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT OF A CIVIL BUT OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE THE DISTEMPERED IMAGINATIONS OF MEN WERE AGITATED WITH A CONTINUAL DREAD OF POPERY WITH A HORROR AGAINST PRELACY WITH AN ANTIPATHY TO CEREMONIES AND THE LITURGY
AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE MOST VIRULENT POISON TO DETERMINE HIS CHOICE IN THE APPROACHING CONTESTS EVERY MAN HEARKENED WITH AVIDITY TO THE REASONS PROPOSED ON BOTH SIDES THE WAR OF THE PEN PRECEDED THAT OF THE SWORD
BUT LETTING THIS MATTER PASS FOR THE PRESENT I WILL MERELY OBSERVE THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF HIS SETTING FOOT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE UNIVERSITY HE BEGAN TO EXERCISE OVER THE HABITS
THAT VERY EXTRAORDINARY EPOCH FORMING THE DOMINATION OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG THEN OF NO PARTICULAR AGE BY WHICH I MEAN THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM A GUESS RESPECTING HIS AGE BY ANY DATA PERSONALLY AFFORDED
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIFTEEN OR FIFTY
TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ME REFERRING YOU TO THIS ADMIRABLE PASSAGE OUGHT TO SATISFY YOUR REQUEST AS A MAN OF HONOR FOR EXPLANATION WITH SENTIMENTS OF PROFOUND RESPECT YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT VON JUNG
AN IMPRESSIVENESS AND AN AFFECTIONATENESS OF MANNER WHICH ELICITED THE WARMEST ENTHUSIASM FROM HIS HEARERS IN GENERAL AND ABSOLUTELY STAGGERED EVEN MYSELF WHO WELL KNEW HIM TO BE AT HEART
A RIDICULER OF THOSE VERY POINTS FOR WHICH HE CONTENDED AND ESPECIALLY TO HOLD THE ENTIRE FANFARONADE OF DUELLING ETIQUETTE IN THE SOVEREIGN CONTEMPT WHICH IT DESERVES
BUT IT WAS UPON HIS MINUTE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DUELLO AND THE NICETY OF HIS SENSE OF HONOR THAT HE MOST ESPECIALLY PRIDED HIMSELF THESE THINGS WERE A HOBBY WHICH HE RODE TO THE DEATH TO RITZNER
INTRODUCTION THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS DISTINCTLY A MODERN CHARACTER IN EARLY LITERATURE WRAITHS TOOK THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
AND INSISTED ON A PROPER SHOW OF RESPECTFUL FEAR ON THE PART OF THOSE WHOM THEY HONORED BY HAUNTING A MORTAL WAS EXPECTED TO RISE WHEN A GHOST ENTERED THE ROOM AND IN CASE HE WAS SLOW ABOUT IT
AND HAVE CHIVALROUSLY SPARED THE GENTLER SHADES AND THERE ARE VERY FEW FUNNY CHILD GHOSTS YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY NONE IN COMPARISON WITH THE NUMBER OF GROWN UPS
THE NUMBER OF GHOST CHILDREN OF ANY OR ALL TYPES IS SMALL PROPORTIONATELY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT SEEMS AN UNNATURAL THING FOR A CHILD TO DIE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
WHERE THE SUITOR ON THE MOONLIT PORCH ATTEMPTING TO TELL HIS FAIR ONE THAT HE DOTES ON HER SEES THE GHOST OF HER FEROCIOUS UNCLE WHO ISN'T DEAD
IN THAT WE HAVE A CONVENTIONAL YOUNG BACHELOR ENGAGED TO A CHARMING GIRL WHO IS ENTANGLED IN SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS AND MADE TO SUFFER MENTAL TORMENT BECAUSE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT
HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
REALLY FRANKLY HE ASKED
WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
SHE WOULD FIND HIM STROKABLE AND THE LION IN HIM
SHE WOULD FIND THAT INSPIRING
UNTAMABLE IN THE MAN THEY LOVE WELL THERE IT WAS IT WAS NOT AS IF HE HAD CORONEL WITH HIM CORONEL AND HE IN HIS PRESENT HEALTH COULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO EURALIA TOGETHER
A WOMAN'S LIFE SAVED THE CAUSE OF HER FALLING INTO THE SEA
CARRYING THEIR HEADS AT THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR TAILS I CROSSED CONTINUED HE ONE PRODIGIOUS RANGE OF ROCKS EQUAL IN HEIGHT TO THE ALPS THE TOPS OR HIGHEST PARTS OF THESE MARINE MOUNTAINS
AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
AND THEN I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER NOTHING SHALL STOP ME NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
THE PRISONER WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE BED NOW BY ONE LEG BEFORE THE SEVEN MEN HAD TIME TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND DASH FORWARD HE HAD BENT DOWN INTO THE FIREPLACE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THE BRAZIER
SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
AND ABOVE THE KNEE AND ON THE INNER SIDE AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPANSE OF BRUISED SURFACE A KIND OF CLOSELY STIPPLED SHADING OF CONTUSED POINTS
EVEN IN LITERATURE ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE NOW THE READER MAY BE INCLINED TO WONDER HOW A RESPECTABLE YOUNG SHOPMAN
THUS EVEN IN A SHOP ASSISTANT DOES THE WARMTH OF MANHOOD ASSERT ITSELF AND DRIVE HIM AGAINST ALL THE CONDITIONS OF HIS CALLING AGAINST THE COUNSELS OF PRUDENCE AND THE RESTRICTIONS OF HIS MEANS
AS WITHOUT KNOCKING STEPHEN ENTERED BECHAMEL'S FACE SUGGESTED A DIFFERENT EXPECTATION BEG PARDON SIR SAID STEPHEN WITH A DIPLOMATIC COUGH WELL SAID BECHAMEL WONDERING SUDDENLY IF JESSIE HAD KEPT SOME OF HER THREATS
HE ROSE WITH A FINE SURPRISE GONE HE SAID WITH A HALF LAUGH GONE SIR ON HER BICYCLE ON HER BICYCLE WHY SHE WENT SIR WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN THIS TIME BECHAMEL WAS REALLY STARTLED
I'LL CHUCK THIS INFERNAL BUSINESS THEY'VE GONE EIGH YESSIR
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OFF WITH HIM AND THAT LITTLE BUSINESS WAS OVER AND HE WAS HERE STRANDED AND SOLD
THEN AMIDST VILLAS AGAIN SOME WARM AND LAMPLIT SOME WHITE AND SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THEN BETWEEN HEDGES OVER WHICH THEY SAW BROAD WAN MEADOWS SHROUDED IN A LOW LYING MIST
AT A FOOTFALL AT A ROUGHNESS IN THE ROAD SHE SEEMED TO BE TOO INTENT UPON ESCAPE TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HIM
NOWHERE WAS THE MOON SHINING QUITE SO BRIGHTLY AS IN MISTER HOOPDRIVER'S SKULL AT THE TURNINGS OF THE ROAD HE MADE HIS DECISIONS WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND PROMPTITUDE AND QUITE HAPHAZARD THE RIGHT HE WOULD SAY OR AGAIN
YOU ARE SAFE SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SWEEPING OFF HIS CAP WITH AN AIR AND BOWING COURTLY WHERE ARE WE SAFE BUT WHERE CHICHESTER HARBOUR HE WAVED HIS ARM SEAWARD AS THOUGH IT WAS A GOAL DO YOU THINK THEY WILL FOLLOW US
I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T TAKE ANYTHING JESSIE THE GLORY OF HAVING HER EVEN AS A SISTER AND TO CALL HER JESSIE LIKE THAT BUT HE CARRIED IT OFF SPLENDIDLY AS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ADMIT GOOD NIGHT SIS HE SAID AND PLEASANT DREAMS
WHERE HE SPENT HIS TIME IN KNOCKING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL UNTIL THE COURTIERS WERE AFRAID HE WOULD KILL HIMSELF THEY ACCORDINGLY PLACED STUFFED MATTRESSES OVER EVERY WALL AND ALLOWED ALL HIS SUBJECTS WHO DESIRED
IF YOU WILL ONLY GIVE ME BACK MY PRINCESS AM NOT I SHE SAID TROUTINA IT WAS TO ME YOU GAVE THIS RING TO ME YOU SPOKE AT THE WINDOW I HAVE BEEN WICKEDLY DECEIVED CRIED THE KING
AND DRESSING HER OWN DAUGHTER IN RICH GARMENTS WITH A GOLD CROWN ON HER HEAD AND KING CHARMING'S RING ON HER FINGER SHE TOOK HER TO THE TOWER FLORINA YOUR SISTER IS COME TO SEE AND BRING YOU MARRIAGE PRESENTS
WHY CAN I NOT RETURN AND GOVERN IT AS BEFORE I FEAR REPLIED HIS FRIEND THAT THE THING IS DIFFICULT WHO WOULD OBEY A BLUE BIRD AH THAT IS TOO TRUE CRIED THE KING SADLY
AND THE OTHER FOR TROUTINA THEY ARRIVED SHORTLY HE MORE CHARMING AND SHE MORE REPULSIVE THAN EVER KNITTING HER BROWS TROUTINA EXCLAIMED WHAT CREATURE IS THAT WHO DARES APPROACH SO NEAR MY GOLDEN THRONE
THESE BRACELETS ARE WORTH HALF MY KINGDOM I DID NOT THINK THERE HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONE PAIR IN THE WORLD THEN I WILL BUY THESE SAID TROUTINA BUT FLORINA REFUSED TO SELL THEM FOR MONEY
AND MADE THE MICE GALLOP AND THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOW TILL THE PRINCESS WAS DELIGHTED AND READY TO BUY THE CURIOSITY AT ANY PRICE AGAIN FLORINA EXACTED PERMISSION TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AND AGAIN THE KING
THEIR MOTHER HAD BROUGHT UP A LARGE FAMILY AND WAS NOT STRONG SHE HAD JUST CAST THE SHELL WHICH SHE HAD WORN FOR A YEAR AND NOW SHE WAS WEAK AND HELPLESS UNTIL THE NEW ONE SHOULD HARDEN ON HER IT IS SUCH A BOTHER SHE SAID
THEY GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THEM SWIMMING TO HIM SOME WALKING FORWARD SOME SIDEWISE AND SOME BACKWARD IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THEM WHICH WAY THEY CAME THEY WERE RESTLESS PUPILS AND THEIR TEACHER COULD NOT KEEP THEM FROM LOOKING BEHIND THEM
ONE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE FELLOW CALLED OUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE EELS MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER LET ME GO NEAR THEM AND NOW THEY'VE MOVED AWAY AND I WON'T EVER SEE THEM AND I THINK IT'S JUST HORRID EELS MY CHILDREN SAID THEIR TEACHER
STRETCHING HIS EIGHT WALKING LEGS AND HIS TWO PINCHING CLAW LEGS AND HIS TAIL PADDLES BUT REMEMBER THIS ONE THING IF YOU EVER SEE AN EEL GET OUT OF HIS WAY DON'T STOP
ALL OF WHICH MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND WAS ONLY SAID TO ANNOY HIS TEACHER THEY SCRAMBLED AWAY OVER THE POND BOTTOM
BIG BROTHER GNAWED AWAY NOW TRY IT SAID HE THE BACHELOR BACKED CAREFULLY OUT THROUGH THE OPENING AND STOOD THERE LOOKING TIRED AND HUNGRY AND VERY MUCH RUMPLED YOU ARE A FINE YOUNG MINK SAID HE
SAID HE WHEN I HAVE LEARNED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE VERY BEST WAY IT WILL BE LUCK OF MY OWN OF COURSE ANSWERED THE BACHELOR
THE OTHER POND PEOPLE LIKED THEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MINKS THE WILD DUCKS WHO NESTED IN THE SEDGES WERE QUITE WILLING THAT THE YOUNG MUSKRATS SHOULD PLAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THE MUD HENS WERE NOT AFRAID OF THEM
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUR ON THEIR TAILS OR ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE PARTS WERE BLACK THESE FIFTEEN CHILDREN HAD BEEN FAIRLY WELL BROUGHT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD MANY CARES
WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
FOR THEY KNEW THAT THE MUSKRAT WHO IS HURT IN WINTER NEVER GETS WELL AFTER SHE HAD LET THEM THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE SHE SAID I SHALL PUNISH YOU ALL FOR THIS
BUT I SHALL CHOOSE THE GAMES THE OLDEST FIVE WILL PLAY MUD TURTLES IN WINTER THE NEXT FIVE WILL PLAY FROGS IN WINTER AND THE YOUNGEST FIVE WILL PLAY SNAKES IN WINTER
THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE PERISHED IN THESE WATERWAYS AS THEY TRIED TO GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE HAZY LIGHTS ON THE COAST HOW MANY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THESE OPAQUE MISTS HOW MANY COLLISIONS HAVE OCCURRED WITH THESE REEFS
AT THESE TROUBLE SPOTS SO PROMINENT IN THE STATISTICS CAPE RACE SAINT PAUL ISLAND THE STRAIT OF BELLE ISLE THE SAINT LAWRENCE ESTUARY
A CRUST OF CAKED GRAVEL PROTECTED IT FROM ANY MOLLUSKS THAT MIGHT BORE INTO IT IT RESTED SERENELY SHELTERED FROM THE SEA'S MOTIONS UNDER A PRESSURE FAVORABLE TO THE TRANSMISSION
THE NEXT DAY JUNE FIRST THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO THE SAME TACK IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO LOCATE SOME PRECISE SPOT IN THE OCEAN JUST AS ON THE DAY BEFORE
AND TOOK HIS SIGHTS WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION THE ABSOLUTE CALM OF THE WAVES FACILITATED THIS OPERATION THE NAUTILUS LAY MOTIONLESS NEITHER ROLLING NOR PITCHING I WAS ON THE PLATFORM JUST THEN
IT FOUGHT VALIANTLY AGAINST THE PRESTON ON JULY FOURTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE AS A MEMBER OF THE SQUADRON UNDER ADMIRAL D'ESTAING IT ASSISTED IN THE CAPTURE
OF THE ISLAND OF GRENADA ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE UNDER THE COUNT DE GRASSE IT TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE OF CHESAPEAKE BAY IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR
THIS BROUGHT IT ABREAST OF SAINT JOHN'S IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND HEART'S CONTENT WHERE THE ATLANTIC CABLE REACHES ITS END POINT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING NORTH THE NAUTILUS TOOK AN EASTERLY HEADING
AS IF TO GO ALONG THIS PLATEAU ON WHICH THE TELEGRAPH CABLE RESTS WHERE MULTIPLE SOUNDINGS HAVE GIVEN THE CONTOURS OF THE TERRAIN WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY IT WAS ON MAY SEVENTEENTH
THEN THE CABLE WAS RESUBMERGED BUT A FEW DAYS LATER IT SNAPPED AGAIN AND COULDN'T BE RECOVERED FROM THE OCEAN DEPTHS
OR IF THEY HAD BEEN FLYING BY NIGHT AS THEY USUALLY DID THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED NEARER THE GROUND AND THEIR LEADER WOULD HAVE TRUMPETED LOUDLY TO LET HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW WHICH WAY HE WAS GOING THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TRUMPETED BUT MORE SOFTLY TO TELL HIM THAT THEY WERE COMING AFTER
HE WOULD BEND HIS BODY STRETCH OUT HIS NECK OPEN HIS LONG SLENDER BILL AND SWALLOW IT AT ONE GULP THEN HE WOULD SEEM TO FALL ASLEEP AGAIN WHILE MOST OF THE CRANES WERE STILL FEEDING SOME OF THEM WERE STALKING THROUGH THE WOODS AND LOOKING THIS WAY AND THAT
THEN THEY STOOD AND FISHED FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING WHEN SHE FLEW AWAY SHE SAID THAT IS A VERY PLEASANT FISHING PLACE HE STOOD ON THE OTHER LEG FOR A WHILE AND THOUGHT HOW SWEET HER VOICE SOUNDED AS SHE SAID IT
HE BOWED TO HER OFTENER THAN TO ANY OF THE REST AND HE THOUGHT SHE NOTICED IT THEY DANCED UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST TOO TIRED TO MOVE
IT IS A LOVELY PLACE BUT I COULD NEVER HAVE A NEST ALONE LET ME HELP YOU HE SAID I WANT TO MARRY AND HAVE A HOME WHY SAID SHE AS SHE PREENED HER FEATHERS THAT IS A VERY GOOD PLAN
WITH HER TAIL TWISTED CARELESSLY AROUND A WILLOW BRANCH THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND A MUD TURTLE FATHER WERE IN THE SHALLOW WATER BELOW HER HER SLENDER FORKED TONGUE WAS DARTING IN AND OUT OF HER OPEN MOUTH
THEY DO NOT ALWAYS TAKE SO MANY HOME AS THEY BROUGHT THE SNAPPING TURTLE BECAME VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HIS WARTY RIGHT FORELEG AND DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THE MUD TURTLE SMILED I HAVE HEARD SHE WENT ON
THAT WHEN YOUNG DUCKS DIVE HEAD FIRST THEY ARE QUITE SURE TO COME UP AGAIN BUT THAT WHEN THEY DIVE FEET FIRST THEY NEVER COME UP
MOST OF THEM REMARKED THE TURTLES ALL OF THEM SHE SAID EXCEPT US ADDERS AND THE TURTLES I EVEN THINK THAT SOME OF THE TURTLES ARE A LITTLE QUEER DON'T YOU WE HAVE THOUGHT SO SAID THE MUD TURTLE
SAID THE MUD TURTLE AND HE SWAM AWAY WITH THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT A RUDE PERSON SHE IS THEY SAID ALWAYS TRYING TO SHOW HOW MUCH MORE CLEVER SHE IS THAN OTHER PEOPLE WE WOULD RATHER BE STUPID AND POLITE AFTER A WHILE THE SNAPPING TURTLE SAID
WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO HIS HOME BY THE ELM TREE HE WAS VERY THIN AND LOOKED AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SICK THE KATYDIDS WHO STAYED NEAR SAID THAT HE CROAKED IN HIS SLEEP AND THAT YOU KNOW IS NOT WHAT WELL AND HAPPY FROGS SHOULD DO
SHE PICKED ME UP AND CARRIED ME INSIDE OH HOW FRIGHTENED I WAS MY HEART THUMPED AS THOUGH IT WOULD BURST AND I TRIED MY BEST TO GET AWAY FROM HER SHE DIDN'T HURT ME AT ALL BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET ME GO
AND I COULD HEAR A ROARING SOUND WHICH MEANT THEY WERE TALKING AND LAUGHING THE LAST TIME I GOT OUT
THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO DO ANYTHING USEFUL OR TO THINK MUCH ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE HUNGRY THEY ATE SOME LEAVES AND NEVER THOUGHT WHAT THEY SHOULD EAT THE NEXT TIME THAT THEY HAPPENED TO BE HUNGRY WHEN THEY WERE TIRED THEY WENT TO SLEEP
AND WHEN THEY HAD SLEPT ENOUGH THEY AWAKENED THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO EAT AND SLEEP AND THEY DID NOT OFTEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO THINK THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THOSE MEADOW PEOPLE WHO RUSHED AND SCRAMBLED AND WORKED FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT AND THEY SHOWED VERY PLAINLY HOW THEY FELT
BEFORE THE MORNING LEOPOLD LAY WOUND IN THE NET OF A LOW FEVER ALMOST AS ILL AS EVER BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR LESS TROUBLED AND THAT EVEN HIS MOST RESTLESS DREAMS
AND ANCIENT ART A MUSEUM FOR HIS DREAMING SPIRIT ALREADY AS A CHILD AS A BOY HE HAD FELT THAT PASSION FOR ANTIQUITY DEVELOPING HE LEARNT HOW TO RUMMAGE THROUGH THE STOCKS OF OLD JEWISH DEALERS
AND HIS FAVOURITE HEADGEAR WAS A FADED HAT BATTERED OUT OF SHAPE BY THE RAIN
ON A TAPESTRY OR ON THE MANY CLOSELY HUNG SKETCHES ALL AROUND HIM ALL WITH THE CHARM OF THEIR LINES
AND UNREAL BALANCE BETWEEN A WOMAN WHO SHOWED HERSELF IN THE NUDE FOR A FEW LIRE AND PETRARCH'S LAURA
BUT THE CHIEF MERIT ON WHICH I VALUE MYSELF AND FOUND MY HOPES FOR FUTURE REGARD IS THAT FAITHFUL VERACITY WITH WHICH I HAVE COMPILED THIS INVALUABLE LITTLE WORK
SALVATION ARMY A DRUM POUNDS OUT THE HYMN LOUD WITH GAUDY ANGELS TINSEL CHERUBIM TO DROWN THE FANFARE OF THE STREET AND WITH EXULTANT LILTING BEAT
TO EARTH'S BROOD OF SOULS OF OLD WITH COVERED HEADS AND ASPEN WANDS MIST SHROUDED PRIESTS DO ANCIENT RITES THE BLACK RAM'S FLEECE IS STAINED WITH BLOOD THAT STEAMS DULL RED ON THE FROZEN GROUND
RHYTHMED CLANK OF TRAIN COUPLINGS AT NIGHT AND THE STORMY GAY TINTED SUNRISES THAT SHADE WITH PURPLE THE CONTOURS OF FAR OFF UNFAMILIAR HILLS NIGHT PIECE
THE MOON HAS TANGLED THE DULL NIGHT IN HER SILVER SKEIN AND SET ALIGHT EACH DEW DAMP BRANCH WITH MILKY FLAME AND HUGE THE MOON BROODS ON THE NIGHT MY SOUL IS CAUGHT IN THE WEB OF THE MOON
BUT WHAT APPEARED TO THE CURATE A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED AT LENGTH SHE SAID WITH FALTERING VOICE SUPPOSE IT WERE A GREAT WRONG THAT HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT WAS THE UNENDURABLE THOUGHT SUPPOSE I SAY
THEN GIVE ME SOME FOOD SOME HOPE I MEAN AND TRY ME AGAIN WITHOUT THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT DUTY OR LIFE OR ANYTHING TELL ME THEN WHAT IS THE MATTER
SHE TRIED HARD BUT COULD NOT PREVENT A SOB
THEN TO FORGIVE AND CONSOLE ME ALAS ALAS THAT HE WILL NOT HEAR OF HE WOULD RATHER BE PUNISHED THAN CONSOLED I FEAR FOR HIS BRAIN BUT INDEED THAT MIGHT BE WELL
BUT ALAS WHAT SECURITY HAD SHE THAT A MAN CAPABLE OF SUCH PRIESTLY SEVEIRITY AND HEARTLESSNESS
WAS THIS WHAT CAME OF PRAYING SHE THOUGHT BITTERLY SOMETHING OR OTHER I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY RETURNED LEOPOLD OH HELEN HE BROKE OUT WITH A CRY STIFLED BY THE CAUTION THAT HAD GROWN HABITUAL TO BOTH OF THEM
FOR WHAT ATTEMPT EVEN HAD HE MADE TO COMFORT HER WHAT HAD HE DONE BUT UTTER COMMON PLACES AND TRUISMS ABOUT DUTY AND WHO COULD TELL BUT
A HUMAN SOUL IN GUILT AND AGONY IS AN AWFUL PRESENCE BUT THERE WAS MORE THAN THAT IN THE HUSH OF THE CURATE HE FELT AS IF HE HAD LEFT THE PHYSICIAN OF SOULS BEHIND HIM AT THE BEDSIDE
I THINK I NEVER SAW A LOVELIER DISPOSITION I DO HOPE HIS MIND WILL SOON BE MORE COMPOSED I THINK HE KNOWS WHERE ALONE HE CAN FIND REST I AM WELL AWARE HOW FOOLISH THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK SEEMS TO SOME MINDS MISS LINGARD
THE DWARF EXCLAIMED HELEN SHUDDERING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD GONE THROUGH AT THE COTTAGE YES THAT MAN'S SOUL IS AS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL AND PATIENT AS HIS BODY IS INSIGNIFICANT AND DISTORTED AND TROUBLED
THE SUN HAS BEEN SO HOT LATELY THAT I WAS SURE YOU WOULD DO WELL THE MOTHER TURTLE STRETCHED HER HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT UNTIL THERE WAS HARDLY A WRINKLE LEFT IN HER NECK SKIN SHE WAS SO EAGER TO SEE THEM ALL
THE FIRST YEAR I HAD ONLY A FEW CHILDREN THE NEXT YEAR I HAD MORE AND SO IT HAS GONE EVERY YEAR A FEW MORE CHILDREN THAN THE YEAR BEFORE UNTIL NOW I NEVER KNOW QUITE HOW MANY I DO HAVE BUT THERE IS ALWAYS ONE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
AND SLID INTO THE WATER ALL HER FRIENDS FOLLOWING HER THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE SAW THESE GREAT ANIMALS COMING TOWARD HIM HE SPRAWLED OFF THE END OF HIS LOG AND SLID INTO THE WATER AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS FOLLOWED HIM EXCEPT THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
BUT CUDDLED INSIDE HIS TWO SHELLS AND WENT TO SLEEP ALSO HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE SKY WHEN HE DID OPEN HIS EYES HIS RELATIVES WERE SITTING AROUND LOOKING AT HIM AND HE REMEMBERED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE SLEPT
HE IS THE QUICKEST ONE IN HIS FAMILY THE POND PEOPLE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED THAT IS QUEER THEY SAID AFTER THIS WE WILL CALL HIM THE QUICK LITTLE TURTLE THIS MADE HIM VERY HAPPY AND WHEN ONCE IN A WHILE SOMEBODY FORGOT
ON THE OCCASION OF THE RETURN OF THE AMISTAD CAPTORS TO THEIR NATIVE LAND AND NOW DOING SO MUCH FOR THE FREEDMEN OF THE SOUTH WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY ESTABLISHED BY HIS EFFORTS DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF SLAVERY MUCH WAS DONE BY THIS SOCIETY
AND IN HIS ADVANCED YEARS SEES NOW SOME OF THE GREAT RESULTS OF HIS LIFE LONG EFFORTS FOR THE RESTORATION AND MAINTENANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS ALTHOUGH STILL SUFFERING UNDER MANY OF THE EVILS WHICH SLAVERY HAS INFLICTED UPON HIM THE AMERICAN SLAVE NO LONGER EXISTS
IN ANSWER TO MY INQUIRIES THIS GIRL TOLD ME THE NAME OF THE SOUTHERN CITY AND THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD HELD HER AS A SLAVE AND THE MODE OF HER ESCAPE ET CETERA I WAS WALKING NEAR THE WATER SHE SAID WHEN A WHITE SAILOR SPOKE TO ME
AND HE WARNED THE PEOPLE NOT TO BID FOR HIM FOR HE WOULD NO LONGER BE A SLAVE TO ANY MAN AND IF ANY ONE BOUGHT HIM HE WOULD LOSE HIS MONEY HE ADDED I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO SAY THIS I THEN SPOKE TO THE CROWD
AND READY TO CAST HER ADVICE GRATIS AT EVERY BIRD AND BEAST OF THE WOODS NOW SHE BUSTLED UP TO THE PARSONAGE AT THE TOP OF THE OAK TREE TO TELL OLD PARSON TOO WHIT WHAT SHE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO PREACH FOR HIS NEXT SERMON AND HOW DREADFUL THE MORALS OF THE PARISH WERE BECOMING
WHOSE SUCCESS GRATIFIES HER AMBITION AND PLACES HER IN A DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC POSITION SHE MUST PAY SOMETHING FOR IT I'M SURE BILLY WREN'S WIFE WOULD GIVE HER VERY BILL TO SEE HER HUSBAND IN THE CIRCLES WHERE I AM QUITE AT HOME TO SAY THE TRUTH
WE ARE THE TRUE MUSICAL RACE AND SO POOR MISTER BULLFROG WAS PERSUADED TO FOREGO HIS PLEASANT LITTLE COTTAGE UNDER THE CAT TAILS WHERE HIS GREEN SPECTACLES AND HONEST ROUND BACK HAD EXCITED EVEN IN THE MINDS OF THE BOYS SENTIMENTS OF RESPECT AND COMPASSION
OH I THINK THERE WILL BE NO DANGER SPOKE TOM IF IT COMES ON TO BLOW WE WILL ASCEND OR DESCEND OUT OF THE PATH OF THE STORM THIS CRAFT IS NOT LIKE THE ILL FATED WHIZZER I CAN MORE EASILY HANDLE THE RED CLOUD EVEN IN A BAD STORM
DAD WILL WANT TO KNOW HOW WE ARE DOING AS HE WORKED AWAY HE ALSO MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND ANOTHER MESSAGE IN CARE OF HIS FATHER FOR THERE WAS A RECEIVING STATION IN THE SWIFT HOME AND TO WHOM THIS MESSAGE WAS ADDRESSED TOM DID NOT SAY
HE WAS READY TO SERVE HIS GUESTS BEFORE HE FORWARDED HIS OWN WIRELESS NOTES JUST TELL MY WIFE THAT I'M ENJOYING MYSELF REQUESTED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY FOOTSTOOL BUT THIS IS GREAT WE'RE OFF THE EARTH YET
ASKED MISTER JENKS RISING FROM HIS SEAT THE MYSTERIOUS MAN IS ABOARD THE AIRSHIP HIDDEN AWAY CRIED TOM THAT'S WHAT ERADICATE WAS TRYING TO CALL TO OUR ATTENTION AS WE STARTED OFF
HE INQUIRED OF TOM YES WAS THE HESITATING ANSWER BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE THEM IF I CAN HELP IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DANGER AND A DISLIKE OF SHEDDING BLOOD BUT
BECAUSE A STRAY BULLET MIGHT PIERCE THE GAS BAG AND DAMAGE THE SHIP THAT'S SO AGREED MISTER JENKS WELL I GUESS IF WE GO AT IT THE RIGHT WAY WE CAN CAPTURE HIM WITHOUT ANY SHOOTING BUT WE MUST TALK MORE QUIETLY
WHISPERED MISTER DAMON WE'LL SOON FIND OUT ANSWERED TOM LET'S GO IN THEY ENTERED AND IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR PLAN TOM AND HIS FRIEND TALKED OF VARIOUS FOODS
AND THEN GO ON BEFORE YOU CAN SEND ANY WORD TO YOUR CONFEDERATES WE'LL PUT YOU OFF IN THE MOST LONESOME SPOT WE CAN FIND AND I GUESS YOU'LL BE SOME TIME GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION BY THAT TIME WE'LL HAVE THE SECRET OF THE DIAMONDS YOU NEVER WILL
CONSTANCE RANG THE BELL MARTHA WHO WAS THE ONLY MAID KEPT EXCEPT THE COOK APPEARED IN ANSWER TO IT LADY AUGUSTA WAS WONT TO SAY THAT SHE HAD TOO MUCH EXPENSE WITH HER BOYS TO KEEP MANY SERVANTS AND THE ARGUMENT WAS A TRUE ONE
THERE IS SO MUCH ILL TO UNDO CAROLINE IS THE WORST THE WEEDS WITH HER HAVE HAD LONGER TIME TO GET AHEAD I THINK PERHAPS IF I COULD KEEP HER WHOLLY WITH ME FOR A TWELVEMONTH OR SO WATCHING OVER HER CONSTANTLY A GREAT DEAL MIGHT BE EFFECTED
REPLIED MISTER CHANNING I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS EXPERIENCE IN ANOTHER LINE MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU CONTINUED MISTER YORKE
THE CHANNINGS THEMSELVES WERE SILENT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE WAY AT ALL CLEAR WHEN MISTER YORKE WAS LEAVING HE BECKONED CONSTANCE AND ARTHUR INTO THE HALL
THERE WAS A LITTLE CHAPEL DOWN A LANE LEADING FROM THE MAIN STREET OF THE VILLAGE IN WHICH THERE WAS SERVICE THREE TIMES EVERY SUNDAY
BUT I DID NOT WAIT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS NOW IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME THAT TOM BORE WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT AT THAT MOMENT PROCEEDINGS WERE THUS DRIVEN TO EXTREMITY I RANG THE BELL FOR MY BOOTS AND TO THE OPEN MOUTHED DISMAY OF MISSUS PEARSON LEFT THE VICARAGE LEANING ON TOM'S ARM
NOW I SAID CARRY IT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHY SIR INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNRIGG IT'S ALL RIGHT YES I SAID AS RIGHT AS THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE IT
AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
MY DEAR SIR I DO NOT LIKE WRITING LETTERS ESPECIALLY ON SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND CHANCES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEREAS IN A PERSONAL INTERVIEW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF CONTROVERSY BEING HALLOWED BY COMMUNION
TO MISSUS TEMPLETON FOR NOT INVITING HER WITH YOU
HAVING RECEIVED FROM IT A THOUSAND INFLUENCES FOR GOOD IF IN NO OTHER WAY YET THROUGH YOUR FATHERS TO FIND IT NO GREAT HARDSHIP AND NOT VERY UNREASONABLE TO PAY A TRIFLE TO KEEP IN REPAIR ONE OF THE TABERNACLES IN WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS WORSHIPPED TOGETHER IF
NOW I DO NOT WRITE ALL THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHURCH RATE QUESTION I WRITE IT TO COMMEMORATE THE SPIRIT IN WHICH MISTER TEMPLETON MET ME FOR IT IS OF CONSEQUENCE THAT TWO MEN WHO LOVE THEIR MASTER SHOULD RECOGNIZE EACH THAT THE OTHER DOES SO AND THEREUPON IF NOT BEFORE
ALL THE WITNESSES WHO HAD ANYTHING TO SAY HAD LONG AGO GIVEN IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND WHEN AT OR NEAR NOON
LOOKED AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND TO HIM A FULL ATTENTION WAS BEING GIVEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOME REAL ENLIGHTENMENT WOULD COME AT LAST TO SETTLE THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY AMABEL'S INCOMPLETE AND UNSATISFACTORY TESTIMONY BUT NO MAN CAN FURNISH WHAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS
AND QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING A VERY UNSELFISH ACT STILL THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE REASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO INTRUDE UPON HER LATE AT NIGHT WITH A PLEA FOR A LARGE LOAN OF MONEY HAD I NOT BEEN IN A DESPERATE CONDITION OF MIND
AND SO HASTENED ON TILL I CAME TO THE GATE ON HIGH STREET HERE I HAD A MOMENT OF HESITATION AND THOUGHTS BITTER ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECALL THEM AT THIS MOMENT CAME INTO MY MIND
WHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDED
EVERYONE WAS ASTOUNDED NO ONE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM HIM AND INSTINCTIVELY EVERY EYE TURNED TOWARDS AMABEL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS AFFECTED BY HIS ACTION STRANGELY EVIDENTLY
IF YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS I WILL REPEAT MY TALE IN YOUR EARS BUT GO NOW IT IS MY LAST ENTREATY THERE WAS A SILENCE NO ONE VENTURED A DISSENT
THIS YOU WILL BELIEVE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE PERSON MISS PAGE FOLLOWED INTO MISSUS WEBB'S HOUSE AND WHOM SHE HEARD DESCEND THE STAIRS DURING THE MOMENT SHE CROUCHED BEHIND THE FIGURE OF THE SLEEPING PHILEMON IT WAS MORE
I SAW THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD ON HIS ARMS ASLEEP THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD FAILED TO ARRIVE AND HE TIRED OUT WITH WAITING HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE AT THE BOARD
AND PRAYED ME TO SEE THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN BEFORE I SLEPT SINCE NOTHING BUT DEATH OR DIRE DISTRESS WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM FROM GRATIFYING THE ONE WHIM OF MY FATHER'S FAILING MIND I PROMISED
FREDERICK HIMSELF FELT THE CHANGE AND SHOWED IT BY THE LOOK OF RELIEF AND GROWING CONFIDENCE HE CAST AT AGNES OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHICH NOW PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE JURY I NEED GIVE NO ACCOUNT
WERE HE LOVER HUSBAND OR SON SO AMABEL BELIEVED AND SO WOULD THESE OTHERS BELIEVE ALSO WHEN ONCE RELIEVED OF THE MAGNETIC PERSONALITY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY WITNESS
NOT EVEN FOR HIS MONEY FOR SHE COULD CONTEMPLATE ITS LOSS BUT FOR HIMSELF WHO HAD SO BOLDLY SHOWN THAT HE WAS STRONGER THAN SHE AND COULD TRIUMPH OVER HER BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HIS MASCULINE DARING
HIS OLD PAGAN SCHOOLFELLOWS GATHERED ROUND HIM HE WAS ALWAYS WITH THEM THE HAPPY HOME LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITS CHARM THE WANT OF PRINCIPLE AND OF HONOUR IN MOST OF THEM
OF TRICKING THE OWNER OF THE GARDEN THERE WAS THE WILD EXCITEMENT TOO OF THE DARING THE FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT BE CAUGHT IN THE ACT HE WAS CAREFUL TO KEEP SUCH ESCAPADES A SECRET FROM HIS MOTHER BUT MONICA WAS UNEASY
THE END COULD NOT BE FAR OFF MONICA WAS DEVOTING HERSELF HEART AND SOUL TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO CLUNG TO HER WITH TENDER AFFECTION AND WAS NEVER HAPPY IN HER ABSENCE PATRICIUS WATCHED THEM TOGETHER
THE BEAUTIFUL PRAYERS OF THE CHURCH HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE DEPARTING SOUL TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE NEW LIFE AND HAD FOLLOWED IT INTO ETERNITY SHE SEEMED CLOSE TO THEM STILL IN THE LIGHT OF THAT WONDERFUL NEW FAITH
WITH THE SIMPLICITY AND TRUSTFULNESS OF A CHILD HE LOOKED TO HER FOR GUIDANCE AND DID ALL THAT SHE DESIRED THE CEREMONY OVER HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE AND SMILED
SHE HAD BEEN HIS ANGEL HE SAID HE OWED ALL HIS JOY TO HER IT WAS HER LOVE HER PATIENCE THAT HAD DONE IT ALL SHE HAD SHOWN HIM THE BEAUTY OF GOODNESS AND MADE HIM LOVE IT
ROMANIANUS DIVINED HER ANXIETY AND HASTENED TO SET IT AT REST HE HAD A HOUSE IN CARTHAGE HE SAID IT SHOULD BE AUGUSTINE'S AS LONG AS HE REQUIRED IT
AND FORGOT HER OWN GRIEF IN SOLACING THAT OF OTHERS THERE WERE CERTAIN GOOD WORKS WHICH THE CHURCH GAVE TO CHRISTIAN WIDOWS TO PERFORM THE HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE WERE ENTIRELY IN THEIR HANDS
SHE WOULD KEEP THEM IN HER OWN HOUSE FEED THEM AT HER OWN TABLE AND CLOTHE THEM WITH HER OWN HANDS IF I AM A MOTHER TO THESE MOTHERLESS ONES SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF HE WILL HAVE MERCY AND GIVE ME BACK MY BOY
BUT GAVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE POOR OFTEN INDEED SHE WENT COLD AND HUNGRY THAT THEY MIGHT BE CLOTHED AND FED HER LOVE OF PRAYER TOO COULD NOW FIND FULL SCOPE
THAT DREW HIS YOUNG COMPANIONS AND EVEN OLDER MEN TO HIS SIDE A MORE WORLDLY MOTHER THAN MONICA WOULD HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY PROUD OF HER SON FAITH AND VIRTUE WERE ALONE WEAK AND FAINT IN THAT SOUL
DESPISED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE THINGS ARE SAID AND MY INTELLIGENCE COULD NOT DISCOVER THE HIDDEN SENSE
THIS EXTRAORDINARY HERESY HAD BEGUN IN THE EAST AND HAD SPREAD ALL OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD ITS FOLLOWERS FORMED A SECRET SOCIETY WITH SIGNS AND PASSWORDS GRADES AND INITIATIONS
AND FOLLOW THESE MEN FOR ALMOST NINE YEARS BUT THEIR ASSERTION THAT WE WERE TERRIFIED BY SUPERSTITION INTO A FAITH BLINDLY IMPOSED UPON OUR REASON WHILE THEY URGED NO ONE TO BELIEVE
WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE SWEET WEST WIND RISES TO OPEN THE NEW LEAVES WHEREWITH EUROPE IS SEEN TO CLOTHE HERSELF AFRESH NOT FAR OFF FROM THE BEATING OF THE WAVES BEHIND WHICH IN HIS LONG CAREER THE SUN SOMETIMES CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM EVERY MAN
IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
AND WHEN IT WAS CREATED WAS HIS MIND REPLETE WITH SUCH A LIVING ENERGY THAT IN HIS MOTHER HER IT MADE PROPHETIC AS SOON AS THE ESPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAITH AT HOLY FONT WHERE THEY WITH MUTUAL SAFETY DOWERED EACH OTHER
BUT STILL THE ORBIT WHICH THE HIGHEST PART OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE MADE IS DERELICT SO THAT THE MOULD IS WHERE WAS ONCE THE CRUST HIS FAMILY THAT HAD STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVED WITH FEET UPON HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE TURNED ROUND SO THAT THEY SET THE POINT UPON THE HEEL
SO MUCH ENAMOURED I BECAME THEREWITH THAT UNTIL THEN THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT E'ER HAD FETTERED ME WITH SUCH SWEET BONDS PERHAPS MY WORD APPEARS SOMEWHAT TOO BOLD POSTPONING THE DELIGHT OF THOSE FAIR EYES INTO WHICH GAZING MY DESIRE HAS REST
WHO HAST UNTO MY SEED SO COURTEOUS BEEN AND IT CONTINUED HUNGER LONG AND GRATEFUL DRAWN FROM THE READING OF THE MIGHTY VOLUME WHEREIN IS NEVER CHANGED THE WHITE NOR DARK THOU HAST APPEASED MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT IN WHICH I SPEAK TO THEE
AS CINCINNATUS OR CORNELIA NOW TO SUCH A QUIET SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OF THE CITIZEN TO SUCH A SAFE COMMUNITY AND TO SO SWEET AN INN DID MARY GIVE ME WITH LOUD CRIES INVOKED AND IN YOUR ANCIENT BAPTISTERY AT ONCE CHRISTIAN AND CACCIAGUIDA I BECAME
I FOLLOWED IN HIS TRAIN AGAINST THAT LAW'S INIQUITY WHOSE PEOPLE DOTH USURP YOUR JUST POSSESSION THROUGH YOUR PASTOR'S FAULT THERE BY THAT EXECRABLE RACE WAS I RELEASED FROM BONDS OF THE FALLACIOUS WORLD
THE STOCK FROM WHICH WERE THE CALFUCCI BORN WAS GREAT ALREADY AND ALREADY CHOSEN TO CURULE CHAIRS THE SIZII AND ARRIGUCCI O HOW BEHELD I THOSE WHO ARE UNDONE BY THEIR OWN PRIDE AND HOW THE BALLS OF GOLD FLORENCE ENFLOWERED IN ALL THEIR MIGHTY DEEDS
MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
AND THE GOOD ARE RARE WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE THOU WHAT I SAID AND THUS IT CAN CONSIST WITH THY BELIEF OF THE FIRST FATHER AND OF OUR DELIGHT AND LEAD SHALL THIS BE ALWAYS TO THY FEET TO MAKE THEE LIKE A WEARY MAN MOVE SLOWLY
FOR I HAVE SEEN ALL WINTER LONG THE THORN FIRST SHOW ITSELF INTRACTABLE AND FIERCE AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP AND I HAVE SEEN A SHIP DIRECT AND SWIFT RUN O'ER THE SEA THROUGHOUT ITS COURSE ENTIRE TO PERISH AT THE HARBOUR'S MOUTH AT LAST
ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
AND FROM THE SUPPOSED DEATH OF SIR BERNARD IN FACT THE MATTER SO PREYED ON HER NERVES THAT SHE BECAME PROSTRATE AND DOCTOR PAYNE HAD TO BE CALLED IN HE WAS A HANDSOME AND POPULAR YOUNG DOCTOR WHO HAD PRACTICED IN HURSETON
PROBABLY BUT SHE BEARS UP WONDERFULLY BUT THAT SHE IS IN MOURNING ONE WOULD HARDLY GUESS SHE HAD SUSTAINED SUCH A LOSS WAS SHE VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MISTER GORE YES
I NEVER SAW A MORE ATTACHED COUPLE DID YOU EVER MEET HIM ONCE AT MISS PLANTAGENET'S YOU KNOW I AM GREAT FRIENDS WITH THE OLD LADY I OFTEN VISIT HER NOT PROFESSIONALLY FOR SHE IS AS HEALTHY AS A TROUT IN A POND
ALICE HAS SUCH A TENDER HEART DOCTOR PAYNE WAS DOUBTFUL SO FAR AS HE SAW MISS MALLESON WAS REMARKABLY CHEERFUL UNDER HER SORROW SHE IS PHILOSOPHIC MISS RANDOLPH
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM HANGED HE WON'T BE HANGED IF LORD CONNISTON AND MISTER DURHAM CAN SAVE HIM AH JULIUS STARTED TO HIS FEET THEN HE IS ALIVE
I CAN'T SAY I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK HE IS BUT I AM HOPING AGAINST HOPE SAID LUCY RISING I MERELY STATE WHAT WAS SAID MISTER DURHAM AND LORD CONNISTON BOTH TOLD ALICE THAT BERNARD WAS INNOCENT
AND THEN ASKED LUCY STARTING UP AND FACING BERYL
AND OF ALL THE PROPERTY AND OF THE TITLE ALSO
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR VICTORIA
AND DULL SAID JERRY PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LORD WHAT A BORE STOPPING WITH HER WILL BE BUT I CAN NIP OVER AND SEE VICTORIA WHEN I LIKE AND KEEP AN EYE ON LORD CONNISTON AS I TOLD YOU
WHY DO YOU THINK BERNARD IS INNOCENT HE ASKED BECAUSE IF HE IS GUILTY HIS ACTION GIVES THE LIE TO HIS WHOLE LIFE JULIUS SHE REPLIED RAISING HERSELF ON HER ELBOW I CAN'T BELIEVE HE KILLED MY UNCLE
SIR SIMON IS NOT YOUR UNCLE SAID BERYL JEALOUSLY YOU ARE ONLY A DISTANT RELATIVE PERHAPS MY MARRIAGE WITH YOU MAY MAKE ME A NEARER ONE
THIS BOY IS A GRANDSON OF LORD CONNISTON'S HOUSEKEEPER MISSUS MOON AT COVE CASTLE SAID LUCY WITH SOME COLOR IN HER FACE I KNOW DO YOU KNOW LORD CONNISTON ASKED JULIUS SUSPICIOUSLY I HAVE MET HIM ONCE
I SAW HIS LORDSHIP DRESSED AS A SOLDIER HE SNUFFLED AND I TOLD MISTER BERYL HIS LORDSHIP WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE GOT ME TURNED OFF SAYING I WAS UNGRATEFUL
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW EMANCIPATION CAME TO PASS WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A SMALL BOY HE BEGAN TO SHOW THE KEENEST SYMPATHY FOR THE HELPLESS AND OPPRESSED THE ONLY TIME HE BETRAYED ANGER AS A CHILD
AND THEY WOULD WITHHOLD THEIR SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY DELEGATIONS OF ABOLITIONISTS FROM ALL OVER THE NORTH ARRIVED ALMOST DAILY FROM DIFFERENT CITIES TO URGE COAX AND THREATEN THE PRESIDENT
EDWIN M STANTON THE SECRETARY OF WAR HAS DESCRIBED THE SCENE ON THE TWENTY SECOND OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO I HAD A SUDDEN AND PEREMPTORY CALL TO A CABINET MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
HE HOWEVER CONCLUDED TO READ US A CHAPTER FROM ARTEMUS WARD WHICH HE DID WITH GREAT DELIBERATION HAVING FINISHED HE LAUGHED HEARTILY WITHOUT A MEMBER OF THE CABINET JOINING IN THE LAUGHTER
IF LEE HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS THERE HE MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK BY SUCH A BRILLIANT STROKE HE COULD HAVE SURROUNDED AND CAPTURED BALTIMORE AND WASHINGTON THIS WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE GRAND RESULT OF THE WAR
CALLING ON GENERAL SICKLES IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL FOR THE GENERAL HAD LOST A LEG ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHY HE BELIEVED THAT VICTORY WOULD BE GIVEN THE FEDERAL FORCES AT GETTYSBURG
THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING WAS SUFFICIENT NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE APPLAUDED ABRAHAM LINCOLN IF HE HAD MERELY RECITED THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
MISTER LINCOLN TOOK HIS YOUNGEST SON WITH HIM EVERYWHERE ON HIS GREAT MISSION TO FORTRESS MONROE AND THEY THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT THE SOLDIERS SAID MARCHED HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE STREETS OF FALLEN RICHMOND
BECAME PERFECTLY RIGHT AND PROPER WHEN CERTAIN UNKNOWN FACTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WAVING THE STARS AND BARS OUT OF A WHITE HOUSE WINDOW FOR INSTANCE ONE NIGHT
IN A SOLDIER'S UNIFORM IF HE DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER THAN THAT SAID ONE MAN HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BETTER IT'S AN INSULT TO THE NORTH AND THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO STOP IT AND APOLOGIZE TOO
MISTER LINCOLN HAD WRITTEN A SHORT ADDRESS FOR THE OCCASION THE TIMES WERE SO OUT OF JOINT AND EVERY WORD WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK OFF HAND A FRIEND STEPPED OUT ON THE NORTHERN PORTICO WITH HIM
THE FIELDS LAY UNTOUCHED THERE WAS NO PLOUGHING NOR SOWING NO GREEN THINGS GROWING LITTLE OR NOTHING WAS TO BE PURCHASED ONE CARRIED ONE'S OWN FOOD WITH HIM
NO HIGHER PROMPTING THAN CONQUEST FOR CONQUEST'S SAKE AND MERE RACE GLORIFICATION TO GO FAR AND TO ENDURE IT MUST HAVE BEHIND IT AN ETHICAL IMPULSE A SINCERELY CONCEIVED RIGHTEOUSNESS
HERE WE HAVE THE CHINESE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HIM OCCUPYING A VAST LAND OF IMMENSE NATURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES OF A TWENTIETH CENTURY AGE OF A MACHINE AGE
WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
HIS APPEARANCE AND WORDS WERE ALWAYS VAGUELY BENEVOLENT A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER THE DESPONDENT STUDENT HE WOULD TEST THE REALITY OF THIS PHILANTHROPY I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR OLDACRE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR
AND DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION FROM MAGDALENE COLLEGE HE SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF THE SURGERY TABLE LOOKING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE AT MONTGOMERY AND TWISTING THE ENDS OF HIS SMALL BLACK WAXED MOUSTACHE THE SECOND WAS PURVIS THE PUBLICAN
AND HE ALSO LEANED FORWARD IN SILENCE FROM HIS CHAIR A FAT RED HAND UPON EITHER KNEE AND STARED CRITICALLY AT THE YOUNG ASSISTANT SO DID THE THIRD VISITOR FAWCETT THE HORSE BREAKER WHO LEANED BACK HIS LONG THIN LEGS WITH THEIR BOXCLOTH RIDING GAITERS
HAVE YOU BEEN WEIGHED LATELY MISTER MONTGOMERY IT WAS THE FIRST DIRECT QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN ASKED HIM HE HAD STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THEM LIKE A HORSE AT A FAIR AND HE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER HE WAS MORE ANGRY OR AMUSED I AM JUST ELEVEN STONE SAID HE
BUT TRAININ FOR EVERYDAY WORK AIN'T THE SAME AS TRAININ WITH A TRAINER AND I DARE BET WITH ALL RESPEC TO YOUR OPINION MISTER WILSON THAT THERE'S HALF A STONE OF TALLOW ON HIM AT THIS MINUTE THE YOUNG CANTAB PUT HIS FINGERS ON THE ASSISTANT'S UPPER ARM
FOR IT WOULD BE SOMETHIN NEW TO FIND ISAAC FAWCETT AS A SPOIL SPORT WELL THEN WE WILL MAKE UP THE HUNDRED FOR THE STAKE AMONG US AND THE FIGHT STANDS ALWAYS SUPPOSIN THE YOUNG MAN IS WILLIN EXCUSE ALL THIS ROT MISTER MONTGOMERY
OR ANY OTHER SHAPE WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST ITSELF TO YOU YOU SEE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HAVING LOST OUR CHAMPION SO WE REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE A CLAIM UPON YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT GENTLEMEN IT IS VERY UNEXPECTED
TO THINK THAT SUCH SCENES CAN BE ENACTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR PEACEFUL HOME BUT YOU WILL REALISE MISTER MONTGOMERY THAT WHILE THERE ARE SUCH INFLUENCES FOR US TO COUNTERACT IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO OUR HIGHEST
THERE WAS AGE TWENTY THREE AGAINST FORTY THERE WAS AN OLD RING PROVERB THAT YOUTH WILL BE SERVED BUT THE ANNALS OF THE RING OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS A HARD VETERAN FULL OF COOL VALOUR AND RING CRAFT
A VERY INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY NORMAN ERA BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH I SEE TO YOUR GOING TO CROXLEY ON SATURDAY IT IS UPON THAT DATE AS I AM INFORMED THAT THAT RUFFIANLY GLOVE FIGHT TAKES PLACE
FOUR MONTHS CRIED THE PROFESSOR WE HAVE TIME TO GO AND TO RETURN
UNDER THE VERY STREET WHERE DWELT ALL THAT I LOVED MOST IN THE WORLD THEN ONLY FORTY LEAGUES WOULD HAVE SEPARATED US BUT THEY WERE FORTY LEAGUES PERPENDICULAR OF SOLID GRANITE WALL AND IN REALITY WE WERE A THOUSAND LEAGUES ASUNDER
SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT MORNING IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED AND SO GUARDED SHE COULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON
AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
SUBSEQUENTLY EVERY OPPORTUNITY IS MADE USE OF TO DISPARAGE THE NEW ARRIVAL AND EVEN ATTEMPTS TO DO HIM BODILY HARM DIRECT ATTACKS ARE NOT UNHEARD OF
WHO IS A DISTURBING ELEMENT IN HER TENDER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FATHER AND WHO OCCUPIES A POSITION THAT SHE COULD VERY WELL FILL HERSELF ONE LEARNS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS TO WHAT EARLY YEARS THESE IDEAS EXTEND BACK
CHILDREN FREQUENTLY REACT TO THE OEDIPUS IDEA THROUGH STIMULATION BY THE PARENTS WHO IN THE PLACING OF THEIR AFFECTION ARE OFTEN LED BY SEX DIFFERENCES SO THAT THE FATHER PREFERS THE DAUGHTER THE MOTHER THE SON
CAST OUT OF LIFE WAS YIELDED UP TO POETRY AND GIVEN THE FREEST PLAY O RANK HAS SHOWN IN A CAREFUL STUDY HOW THIS VERY OEDIPUS COMPLEX HAS SUPPLIED DRAMATIC LITERATURE
WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF MOTIVES IN UNENDING VARIATIONS DERIVATIONS AND DISGUISES ALSO IN DISTORTED FORMS SUCH AS WE RECOGNIZE TO BE THE WORK OF A CENSOR WE MAY ALSO ASCRIBE THIS OEDIPUS COMPLEX TO THOSE DREAMERS
THE ABSTENTION FROM SEXUAL LIBERTY WHICH SOCIETY DEMANDS IN CERTAIN CASES ALSO SHE IS THE RIVAL WHO OBJECTS TO BEING DISPLACED THE SAME TYPE OF THING OCCURS IN A MORE GLARING MANNER BETWEEN FATHER AND SON
THUS WE ARE MOVED TO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEX LIFE IN THE CHILD ALSO AND WE DISCOVER THE FOLLOWING FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS A MISTAKE TO DENY THAT THE CHILD HAS A SEXUAL LIFE AND TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
BUT THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS WHICH WE HAVE SOLVED BY MEANS OF THE DREAM INTERPRETATION ARE NOT OF THIS REALM THEY ARE MUCH MORE NEARLY THE SAME AS ANY WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT IN OUR WAKING HOURS STILL THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS
IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT ATTACK THE INTERPRETATION ITSELF HE ALMOST ALWAYS ASKS THE QUESTION WHENCE SUCH A WISH COMES
SHE BEAT HER BODY WITH HER FISTS IN A FIT OF ANGER IN ORDER TO KILL THE CHILD HOW MANY MOTHERS WHO TO DAY LOVE THEIR CHILDREN TENDERLY PERHAPS TOO TENDERLY RECEIVED THEM UNWILLINGLY AND AT THE TIME WISHED THAT THE LIFE WITHIN THEM WOULD NOT DEVELOP FURTHER
ONLY WISH TO WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT THE EXACT TERMS OF THE DREAM BUT THE MEANING THEREOF ACCORDING TO ITS INTERPRETATION IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THE MANIFEST DREAM OF THE DEATH OF SOME LOVED PERSON HAS ONLY MADE USE OF SOME FRIGHTFUL MASK
HOW COULD THEY BETTER GRATIFY THIS THAN BY RAISING A CREATURE OF THEIR OWN TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRACY OF THE UNION BUT THE CONVENTION HAVE GUARDED AGAINST ALL DANGER OF THIS SORT WITH THE MOST PROVIDENT AND JUDICIOUS ATTENTION
THEY HAVE NOT MADE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT TO DEPEND ON ANY PREEXISTING BODIES OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE TAMPERED WITH BEFOREHAND TO PROSTITUTE THEIR VOTES BUT THEY HAVE REFERRED IT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO AN IMMEDIATE ACT OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
AND TO THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED UNDER HIS AUSPICES WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST IT MUST BE EVIDENT THAT THE LONGER THE DURATION IN OFFICE THE GREATER WILL BE THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING SO IMPORTANT AN ADVANTAGE
THE INFERENCE FROM IT IS THAT A MAN ACTING IN THE CAPACITY OF CHIEF MAGISTRATE UNDER A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE MUST LAY DOWN HIS OFFICE WILL BE APT TO FEEL HIMSELF TOO LITTLE INTERESTED IN IT TO HAZARD ANY MATERIAL CENSURE OR PERPLEXITY
OR TO EVERY TRANSIENT IMPULSE WHICH THE PEOPLE MAY RECEIVE FROM THE ARTS OF MEN WHO FLATTER THEIR PREJUDICES TO BETRAY THEIR INTERESTS IT IS A JUST OBSERVATION THAT THE PEOPLE COMMONLY INTEND THE PUBLIC GOOD
CAN AFFECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE ON THE LEGISLATURE UNLESS THE ONE WERE POSSESSED OF THE POWER OF APPOINTING OR DISPLACING THE OTHER ONE ANSWER TO THIS INQUIRY MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY REMARKED
HAVE BY RAPID STRIDES REDUCED THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN AND THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NOBILITY WITHIN THE LIMITS THEY CONCEIVED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF A FREE GOVERNMENT WHILE THEY RAISED THEMSELVES TO THE RANK AND CONSEQUENCE OF A COEQUAL BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE
THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL CONFIDENCES AND ATTACHMENTS WOULD BE LIKELY TO INDUCE EVERY NEW PRESIDENT TO PROMOTE A CHANGE OF MEN TO FILL THE SUBORDINATE STATIONS
THAT OF CONTINUING THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND THEN EXCLUDING HIM FROM IT EITHER FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OR FOREVER AFTER THIS EXCLUSION WHETHER TEMPORARY OR PERPETUAL WOULD HAVE NEARLY THE SAME EFFECTS
MIGHT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REGULAR PERQUISITES OF HIS SITUATION AND MIGHT EVEN BE UNWILLING TO RISK THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABUSE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES HIS AVARICE MIGHT BE A GUARD UPON HIS AVARICE
WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE SUMMIT OF HIS COUNTRY'S HONORS WHEN HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME AT WHICH HE MUST DESCEND FROM THE EXALTED EMINENCE FOR EVER AND REFLECTED THAT NO EXERTION OF MERIT ON HIS PART COULD SAVE HIM FROM THE UNWELCOME REVERSE
AND SIGHING FOR A PLACE WHICH THEY WERE DESTINED NEVER MORE TO POSSESS A THIRD ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE
WHERE MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN IN THE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A NATION CAN IT BE WISE TO PUT THIS DESIRABLE AND ESSENTIAL QUALITY UNDER THE BAN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND TO DECLARE THAT THE MOMENT IT IS ACQUIRED ITS POSSESSOR SHALL BE COMPELLED
IN CERTAIN EMERGENCIES OF THE STATE THEIR PRESENCE MIGHT BE OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST OR SAFETY THERE IS NO NATION WHICH HAS NOT AT ONE PERIOD OR ANOTHER EXPERIENCED AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF THE SERVICES OF PARTICULAR MEN
AND WE NEED NOT BE APPREHENSIVE THAT THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH STABILITY WHILE THERE IS EVEN THE OPTION OF CHANGING NOR NEED WE DESIRE TO PROHIBIT THE PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING THEIR CONFIDENCE WHERE THEY THINK IT MAY BE SAFELY PLACED AND WHERE BY CONSTANCY ON THEIR PART
THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE PURE EXPERIENCE THEORY IS THAT OUTER AND INNER ARE NAMES FOR TWO GROUPS INTO WHICH WE SORT EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON THEIR NEIGHBORS
ANY ONE CONTENT SUCH AS HARD LET US SAY CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER GROUP IN THE OUTER GROUP IT IS STRONG IT ACTS ENERGETICALLY AND AGGRESSIVELY
ACTIVELY EFFICACIOUS AS THEY SEEM TO BE WE OURSELVES SUCCEED IN ALTERING NATURE SO AS TO SUIT US AND UNTIL MORE PURELY INTELLECTUAL AS DISTINGUISHED FROM PRACTICAL NEEDS HAD ARISEN
MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES
MOTION ORIGINALLY SIMPLY IS ONLY LATER IS IT CONFINED TO THIS THING OR TO THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TRUE OF EVERY EXPERIENCE HOWEVER COMPLEX
ARE FATHERS UNNATURAL AND CHILDREN PRODIGAL GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO THE HUMAN RACE WHY THEN HAVE I RECEIVED NONE HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS UNDER MY FEET
WILL COME TO ITS DEATH THROUGH OPULENCE
OR THE LABORER MUST LOSE THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR AND WHEREAS IN EVERY OTHER CASE PROPERTY IN RAW MATERIAL WOULD GIVE A TITLE TO ADDED IMPROVEMENTS MINUS THEIR COST
HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THING ENTRUSTED TO HIM HE MUST USE IT IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERAL UTILITY WITH A VIEW TO ITS PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT HE HAS NO POWER TO TRANSFORM IT
THE AMOUNT OCCUPIED BEING MEASURED NOT BY THE WILL BUT BY THE VARIABLE CONDITIONS OF SPACE AND NUMBER PROPERTY CANNOT EXIST
BLIND LAW THE LAW OF THE IGNORANT MAN A LAW WHICH IS NOT A LAW THE VOICE OF DISCORD DECEIT AND BLOOD THIS IT IS WHICH CONTINUALLY REVIVED REINSTATED REJUVENATED
I CAN POSSESS BY SEVERAL TITLES I CAN BECOME PROPRIETOR BY ONLY ONE
IN THIS SON OF EARTH WHO PASSES AWAY LIKE A SHADOW THERE EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO EXTERNAL THINGS ONLY TITLES OF POSSESSION NOT ONE TITLE OF PROPERTY WHY THEN
TO THE FORM WHICH HE GIVES TO THE OBJECT NOT TO THE OBJECT ITSELF USELESS DISTINCTION IF THE FORM COULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR QUESTION
HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID SO HE SHOULD NEVER RISE AGAIN HE WAS OVERCOME BY FATIGUE AND THE WEIGHT OF THE DARKNESS WOULD AS WITH THE DEAD WOMAN HAVE HELD HIM TO THE GROUND AND THE ICE GLUED HIM ALIVE TO THE EARTH
SO FAR AS EYE COULD REACH THE HOUSE TO THE RIGHT WAS A ROOF RATHER THAN A HOUSE NOTHING COULD BE MORE MEAN THE WALLS WERE OF MUD THE ROOF WAS OF STRAW AND THERE WAS MORE THATCH THAN WALL
A LARGE NETTLE SPRINGING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL REACHED THE ROOF THE HOVEL HAD BUT ONE DOOR WHICH WAS LIKE THAT OF A DOG KENNEL AND A WINDOW WHICH WAS BUT A HOLE ALL WAS SHUT UP AT THE SIDE
AN INHABITED PIG STY TOLD THAT THE HOUSE WAS ALSO INHABITED THE HOUSE ON THE LEFT WAS LARGE HIGH BUILT ENTIRELY OF STONE WITH A SLATED ROOF
THE DECOMPOSED THOUGHTS OF THE SLEEPERS FLOAT ABOVE THEM IN A MIST WHICH IS BOTH OF DEATH AND OF LIFE AND COMBINE WITH THE POSSIBLE WHICH HAS ALSO PERHAPS THE POWER OF THOUGHT AS IT FLOATS IN SPACE
EVEN GOOD WOMEN IN THEIR HOUSES A PELL MELL OF SHEDS THROWN FROM HER DEVIL'S BAG WOULD GIVE AN IDEA OF THAT IRREGULAR WEYMOUTH THE GOOD WOMEN IN THE SHEDS INCLUDED THE MUSIC HALL REMAINS AS A SPECIMEN OF THOSE BUILDINGS
HE KNEW THIS BECAUSE HE FELT HER SUCK HIS CHEEK SHE DID NOT CRY BELIEVING HIM HER MOTHER HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN AND WANDER LONG PERHAPS IN THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE SCRAMBRIDGE LANES
THE BRIDGE OPENED ON A RATHER FINE STREET CALLED SAINT THOMAS'S STREET HE ENTERED IT HERE AND THERE WERE HIGH CARVED GABLES AND SHOP FRONTS HE SET TO KNOCKING AT THE DOORS AGAIN
TO LIE DOWN THERE AND DIE HOWEVER THE LITTLE INFANT LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HIS SHOULDER AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN THIS BLIND CONFIDENCE SET HIM ONWARDS AGAIN
MISANTHROPY PLAYS ITS PRANKS A STRANGE AND ALARMING GRINDING OF TEETH REACHED HIM THROUGH THE DARKNESS IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE BACK HE ADVANCED
AND CHAFED BEFORE THE FIRE THE LIMBS OF THE EXHAUSTED AND BEWILDERED CHILD WHO AT THAT MOMENT WARM AND NAKED FELT AS IF HE WERE SEEING AND TOUCHING HEAVEN THE LIMBS HAVING BEEN RUBBED HE NEXT WIPED THE BOY'S FEET
AND THE MAN SLIPPED THE KNITTED JACKET OVER IT NOW THE MAN KICKED THE STOOL FORWARD AND MADE THE LITTLE BOY SIT DOWN AGAIN SHOVING HIM BY THE SHOULDERS THEN HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TO THE PORRINGER WHICH WAS SMOKING UPON THE STOVE
NOT AN IDIOT ON THE HIGHWAY NOT A PENNY IN THE TILL EAT AWAY HELL BORN BOY TEAR AND CRUNCH WE HAVE FALLEN ON TIMES WHEN NOTHING CAN EQUAL THE CYNICISM OF SPONGERS FATTEN AT MY EXPENSE PARASITE
AND YONDER IN THE FIELD IS HER DARK YOUNG HUSBAND HOEING TO SUPPORT HER AT THIRTY CENTS A DAY WITHOUT BOARD ACROSS THE WAY IS GATESBY BROWN AND TALL LORD OF TWO THOUSAND ACRES SHREWDLY WON AND HELD
SHOULD BIND HER OWN TO SLOTH AND MISFORTUNE AS RUTHLESSLY AS EVER ENGLAND DID THE POOR LAND GROANS WITH ITS BIRTH PAINS AND BRINGS FORTH SCARCELY A HUNDRED POUNDS OF COTTON TO THE ACRE WHERE FIFTY YEARS AGO
AND IN HIS LITTLE WORLD WALKED SOULS ALONE UNCOLORED AND UNCLOTHED I YEA ALL MEN ARE LARGER AND PURER BY THE INFINITE BREADTH OF THAT ONE LITTLE LIFE
SHE WHO IN SIMPLE CLEARNESS OF VISION SEES BEYOND THE STARS SAID WHEN HE HAD FLOWN HE WILL BE HAPPY THERE HE EVER LOVED BEAUTIFUL THINGS
SOME MORNING THIS MAY BE LONG LONG YEARS TO COME BUT NOW THERE WAILS ON THAT DARK SHORE WITHIN THE VEIL THE SAME DEEP VOICE THOU SHALT FOREGO
WAS NOT THE WORLD'S ALEMBIC TIME IN HIS YOUNG HANDS AND IS NOT MY TIME WANING ARE THERE SO MANY WORKERS IN THE VINEYARD THAT THE FAIR PROMISE OF THIS LITTLE BODY
AS MISTER MORGESON INTRODUCED HER GIVING US A CORDIAL WELCOME SHE LED US INTO A PARLOR WHERE TEA WAS WAITING A SERVANT CAME IN FOR OUR BONNETS AND BASKETS COUSIN ALICE BEGGED US TO TAKE TEA AT ONCE
THE LAMB CHOPS WERE FRAGILE THE BREAD WAS DELICIOUS BUT CUT IN TRANSPARENT SLICES AND THE BUTTER PAT WAS NEARLY STAMPED THROUGH WITH ITS BOUQUET OF FLOWERS THIS WAS ALL THE FEAST EXCEPT SPONGE CAKE WHICH FELT LIKE MUSLIN IN THE FINGERS
PRESENTLY A GIRL THE SAME WHO HAD TAKEN OUR BONNETS CAME IN WITH A PITCHER OF WARM WATER AND A PLATE OF SODA BISCUIT SHE DIRECTED US WHERE TO FIND THE APPAREL SHE HAD NICELY SMOOTHED AND FOLDED TOOK OFF THE HANDSOME COUNTERPANE AND THE PILLOWS TRIMMED WITH LACE
AS AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND LOCKE MORGESON SOUNDED FAMILIARLY HE SAID A MEMBER OF HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY NAMED SOMERS HAD MARRIED A GENTLEMAN OF THAT NAME HE REMEMBERED IT FROM AN OLD IVORY MINIATURE WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SHOWN HIM
THOUGH I AM SURE THE PERFORMERS THEREOF HAD SMALL ENCOURAGEMENT VERONICA ALONE WOULD SEE NO ONE HER ROOM WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT INVADED FOR THE NEIGHBORS TOOK THE HOUSE INTO THEIR HANDS ASSISTED BY THAT PART OF THE MORGESONS
AND ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE THE UNPROFITABLE TRIAL AS THE COFFIN WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE HEARSE MY HEART TWISTED AND PALPITATED AS IF A COMMAND HAD BEEN LAID UPON IT TO FOLLOW AND NOT LEAVE HER
AT LAST THE WORD WAS GIVEN AND THE LONG PROCESSION BEGAN TO MOVE THROUGH THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED A CAT RAN OUT OF A HOUSE AND SCAMPERED ACROSS THE WAY ARTHUR LAUGHED AND FATHER JUMPED NERVOUSLY AT THE SOUND OF HIS LAUGH
ARTHUR'S HAND WAS IN MINE HE STAMPED HIS FEET FIRMLY ON THE SAND AS IF TO BREAK THE OPPRESSIVE SILENCE WHICH NO ONE SEEMED DISPOSED TO DISTURB THE SAME CEREMONIES WERE PERFORMED IN STARTING US HOMEWARD
THE SACRIFICES HE HAD HEAPED ON THEIR ALTARS AVAILED HIM NOTHING IN THIS NEW NEED AND HUNGER OF HIS BEING HIS GODS MOCKED HIM AND HE WEARIED OF THEIR SERVICE WERE THERE NOT BETTER THINGS THAN THESE
THINGS HE HAD ONCE KNOWN AND LOVED AND FORGOTTEN WHERE WERE THE IDEALS OF HIS YOUTH THE LOFTY ASPIRATIONS THAT HAD UPBORNE HIM THEN WHERE WAS THE EAGERNESS AND ZEST OF NEW DAWNS
THAT NAME HAD ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY BEEN KEPT SACRED TO THE LONG GREEN SEAWARD LOOKING GLEN WHERE HE HAD BEEN BORN SO HE HAD COME BACK TO IT DRAWN BY A LONGING NOT TO BE RESISTED
BUT AT THE LAST HE FELT AFRAID THERE HAD BEEN MANY CHANGES OF THAT HE FELT SURE WOULD IT STILL BE HOME AND IF NOT WOULD NOT THE LOSS BE MOST IRREPARABLE AND BITTER
HE HAD SAID STOUTLY SHE HAD LAUGHED AND SIGHED AND CAUGHT HIM TO HER HEART HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF HIS FATHER WHO HAD DIED SOON AFTER HIS SON'S BIRTH BUT HOW WELL HE REMEMBERED HIS MOTHER
JOYCE ALONE KNEW OF HIS LONGINGS AND HIS AMBITIONS AND HIS DREAMS HE HAD TOLD THEM ALL TO HER FREELY SURE OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY NO OTHER SOUL IN THE VALLEY COULD GIVE HIM
SUDDENLY GLANCING OVER HIS SHOULDER HE SAW THROUGH AN ARCH OF BLACK FIR BOUGHS A YOUNG MOON SWUNG LOW IN A LAKE OF PALELY TINTED SAFFRON SKY HE SMILED A LITTLE
I RATHER SUSPECTED IT FOR AT THE SENIOR PROM THREE NIGHTS BEFORE SHE HAD HARDLY LOOKED AT MICKY BUT HAD SAT IN A CORNER AND TALKED TO THE OLD FELLOW HE DIDN'T DO MUCH TALKING HE WAS TOO SHY AND HE LOOKED MIGHTY UNCOMFORTABLE
HE CAUGHT SYLVIA DOING THE SAME THING SO HE WHEELED AND CAME ON LOOKING MIGHTY FOOLISH AS HE PASSED BENEATH OUR WINDOW RUGGLES CHUCKLED FIENDISHLY I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING POLLY HE SAID MY NAME IS PAUL
LET'S WRITE A LETTER TO SYLVIA GRANT A LOVE LETTER AND SIGN THE OLD FELLOW'S NAME TO IT SHE'LL GIVE HIM A FEARFUL SNUBBING AND WE'LL BE REVENGED BUT WHO'LL WRITE IT I SAID DOUBTFULLY I CAN'T
HE ASSERTS THAT SYLVIA TURNED SQUARE AROUND AND KISSED THE OLD FELLOW BUT I'M SURE SHE JUST TURNED HER FACE AND GAVE HIM A LOOK AND THEN HE KISSED HER ANYHOW
THE TASTE DOES NOT DISCERN THE TOUCH DOES NOT FEEL EVEN ETHEREAL MATTER THE FORCES OF WHICH ARE SAID IN PHYSICS TO BE HEAT LIGHT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
IN EXPLAINING THESE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES ONE IS OBLIGED TO EXPRESS THEM BY SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN EXTERIOR EXISTENCE THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT MATERIAL THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN THE REALITY OF THE SPIRIT
AND WAKEFULNESS IS THE CONDITION OF MOVEMENT SLEEPING IS THE STATE OF SILENCE
WHICH CAN BE COMPARED TO FATHER AND MOTHER AND IT IS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION BUT THE DARKNESS HAS NEITHER SUBSTANCE NOR FORM NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER AND IT IS ABSOLUTE IMPERFECTION THE SUBSTANCE OF ADAM'S PHYSICAL LIFE WAS EARTH
IF THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS HIS BEING FATHERLESS THEN ADAM IS GREATER THAN CHRIST FOR HE HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER IT IS SAID IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE LORD GOD FORMED MAN OF THE DUST OF THE GROUND
NOMINALLY WARDROBES THEY WERE CALLED THE LITTLE ROOMS IT WAS WITHIN THEM THAT EVIL DEEDS WERE HATCHED
ONCE IN AN OCCUPANT REMAINED THERE TILL THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE DECREED HIS OR HER RELEASE THEY WERE GILDED OUBLIETTES SAVOURING BOTH OF THE CLOISTER AND THE HAREM THEIR STAIRCASES TWISTED TURNED
PERHAPS THE ARCHITECTS OF THE LITTLE ROOMS BUILDING FOR ROYALTY AND ARISTOCRACY TOOK AS MODELS THE RAMIFICATIONS OF CORAL BEDS AND THE OPENINGS IN A SPONGE THE BRANCHES BECAME A LABYRINTH PICTURES
OR AT LEAST THE LIGHT WHICH LEADS TO IT REGAINED THE SUDDEN INTERVENTION OF SOME MYSTERIOUS CLEMENCY POSSESSED PERHAPS BY DESTINY LIFE SAYING BEHOLD ME IN THE DARKEST RECESS OF THE GRAVE
WHICH WE HAVE HELD TO HAVE COME FROM BELOW HAS IN REALITY COME FROM ABOVE WHO KNOWS ALL THE MYSTERIOUS FORMS ASSUMED BY GOD WHAT WAS THIS ANIMAL PROVIDENCE HAVING REACHED THE RIVER
WITHOUT NOISE OR BARK HE PUSHED FORWARD ON HIS SILENT WAY HOMO ALWAYS FOLLOWED HIS INSTINCT AND DID HIS DUTY BUT WITH THE PENSIVE RESERVE OF AN OUTLAW SOME FIFTY PACES MORE AND HE STOPPED
AND THE AXLETREES SEEMED WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE ALTOGETHER IT PRESENTED AN INDESCRIBABLE APPEARANCE OF BEGGARY AND PROSTRATION THE SHAFTS STUCK UP LOOKED LIKE TWO ARMS RAISED TO HEAVEN
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER PRISCILLA WAS ENGAGED IN LABORIOUSLY TURNING THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING INTO GRAMMATICAL GERMAN AND AS SHE CLOSED THE DICTIONARY AND GRAMMAR WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF SHE REMARKED TO PATTY DO YOU KNOW
SHE HASN'T PAID HER DUES AND AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT
I LEFT MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION ON THE BOOKCASE KATE FERRIS AS PRISCILLA SCRATCHED THE NAME OUT OF THE ROLL BOOK AGAIN SHE REMARKED TO PATTY
SHE INSISTS THAT THERE ISN'T ANY SUCH PERSON IN COLLEGE AND THAT I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN THE NAME DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING SO ABSURD THAT SEEMS TO ME THE ONLY REASONABLE EXPLANATION PATTY AGREED AMICABLY
A PESSIMIST HE SAYS IS A MAN WHO WEARS BOTH BELT AND SUSPENDERS WHEN A BIG JEWELLERY FIRM IN THE CITY PUTS OUT A LARGE AD BAILEY BANKS AND BIDDLE COMPANY WATCHES FOR WOMEN OF SUPERIOR DESIGN AND PERFECTION OF MOVEMENT
OR ANY PAINFUL JOB SO FULL OF PLEASURES AS THE TASK OF CONDUCTING A NEWSPAPER COLUMN THE
IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE NOBODY NOTICES IT HE SOON OUTGROWS THIS AND IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE NOTICE IT AND HE IMAGINES THAT ALL SEE THE PALTRINESS OF IT AS PLAINLY AS HE DOES
ALL THAT ONE NEEDS TO DO TO THAT IS TO WRITE OVER IT THE CAPTION SO DO WE ALL AND PASS ON TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THE MORE A COLYUMIST IS OUT
THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF VIVID LITTLE PICTURES ONE SEES ON THE CITY STREETS DAY BY DAY TO CATCH SOME HINT OF THE MEANING OF ALL THIS TO PRESENT A FEW SCRAWLED NOTES OF THE AMAZING INTEREST AND COLOUR OF THE CITY'S LIFE
THIS VERY RESERVE HOWEVER WAS RATHER DISTASTEFUL TO JUDITH AS REGARDED HERSELF BUT SHE LIKED IT TOWARDS OTHERS SHE HAD PLANNED IT ALL OUT THAT DIETRICH SHOULD MARRY VERONICA SOON AFTER THE CONFIRMATION THAT THEY SHOULD SET UP A PRETTY LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT AND BE HER BELOVED NEIGHBORS
AND I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT THAT IS WORTH MORE THAN FIVE FRANCS TO A FELLOW LIKE YOU WHAT IS IT SHOW IT TO ME
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SOMEBODY COMES OVER FROM FOHRENSEE AND EXPLAINS IT TO THEM HE DOES NOT BELONG THERE BUT I GUESS YOU HAVE SEEN HIM
HE HAS FIERY RED HAIR AND RED BEARD AND RED FACE HE HAS BUSINESS IN FOHRENSEE ONCE A WEEK AND LIVES THE REST OF THE TIME DOWN IN THE CITY AND HE ARRANGES EVERYTHING DOWN THERE AND THEN BRINGS THE ACCOUNT OF GAINS AND LOSSES UP TO THEM BUT IT'S A GOOD DEAL MORE LOSS THAN GAIN
I AM JUST WAITING THOUGH TILL I CAN TRIP HIM UP AND I'LL DO IT WITH A VENGEANCE TOO SO THAT HE WON'T FORGET IT ALL HIS LIFE LONG NOW THAT IS A GOOD IDEA SAID JUDITH YOU'D BETTER TELL HIM THEN THAT YOU DO IT TO PAY YOUR DEBTS
GERTRUDE HERSELF COULD SCARCELY UNDERSTAND POOR GERTRUDE ONE NIGHT AFTER SHE HAD GONE TO HER ROOM SHE HEARD HER SON LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH HASTY STEPS IT HAD BECOME A REGULAR THING NOW SHE HAD OFTEN SAID TO HERSELF
THAT I HAD MY CURIOSITY ROUSED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH BY A SIGHT OF THESE SINGULAR EMBLEMS AS SOON AS I ASCERTAINED THE EXISTENCE OF A BOYS CLUB OF COURSE I WAS READY TO DIE TO JOIN IT AND EVENTUALLY I WAS ALLOWED TO JOIN
THE UNKNOWN VOICE THEN DIRECTED ME TO TAKE TEN STEPS FORWARD AND STOP AT THE WORD HALT I TOOK TEN STEPS AND HALTED STRICKEN MORTAL SAID A SECOND HUSKY VOICE MORE HUSKY IF POSSIBLE THAN THE FIRST
IN A LOW TONE AS IF NOT INTENDED FOR THE EAR OF THE VICTIM DIABOLUS FETCH ME THE RED HOT IRON THE EXPEDITION WITH WHICH THAT TONGUE WOULD DISAPPEAR WAS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS
OUR MEETINGS WERE HELD IN VARIOUS BARNS AT NO STATED PERIODS BUT AS CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGESTED ANY MEMBER HAD A RIGHT TO CALL A MEETING EACH BOY WHO FAILED TO REPORT HIMSELF WAS FINED ONE CENT
CHAPTER TEN I FIGHT CONWAY THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER WHO CHERISHED A STRONG SUSPICION THAT THE CENTIPEDES HAD HAD A HAND IN THE BUSINESS AND THAT PERSON WAS CONWAY
HIS RED HAIR SEEMED TO CHANGE TO A LIVELIER RED AND HIS SALLOW CHEEKS TO A DEEPER SALLOW AS WE GLANCED AT HIM STEALTHILY OVER THE TOPS OF OUR SLATES THE NEXT DAY IN SCHOOL HE KNEW WE WERE WATCHING HIM AND MADE SUNDRY MOUTHS
AND THERE WE WERE GLARING AT EACH OTHER MOTIONLESS NEITHER OF US DISPOSED TO RISK AN ATTACK BUT BOTH ON THE ALERT TO RESIST ONE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW LONG WE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THAT ABSURD POSITION HAD WE NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED
BUT I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO PUT MEEKS'S MORTAR OVER OUR DOOR AND I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO DID IT IT WAS THAT SNEAKING LITTLE MULATTER POINTING AT ME O BY GEORGE I CRIED REDDENING AT THE INSULT
I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ONLY FOLLOWING MY NOSE BUT FOLLOWING IT SO CLOSELY THAT I WAS IN SOME DANGER OF TREADING ON IT I SEEMED TO HAVE NOSE ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE PARTY MY LEFT CHEEK ALSO WAS PUFFED OUT LIKE A DUMPLING
DID YOU SEE MISTER GRIMSHAW LOOKING OUT OF THE RECITATION ROOM WINDOW JUST AS WE LEFT THE YARD NO WAS HE THOUGH I AM SURE OF IT
HE HAD AS WE SUSPECTED WITNESSED THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE FIGHT FROM THE SCHOOL ROOM WINDOW AND THE NEXT MORNING AFTER PRAYERS I WAS NOT WHOLLY UNPREPARED WHEN MASTER CONWAY AND MYSELF WERE CALLED UP TO THE DESK FOR EXAMINATION
THE OCCASION MAY COME ROUND WHEN A DECENT PROFICIENCY IN ONE OR THE REST OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WILL BE OF SERVICE TO YOU IN ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS
FLIRTATIONS WITH EVERYBODY'S MAID IN THIS WAY HE COULD INFORM HIMSELF EXACTLY HOW MANY LOAVES WERE TAKEN BY THE SWEENEYS FOR A WEEK'S CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH THOSE WHICH WERE DEVOURED BY ALL THE CASSIDYS
UPON THE DEEP SOIL OF THE HUMAN HEART WHAT DEASEY CARED ABOUT WAS WHAT HE CALLED THE SECRETS OF THE SOUL NEVER MET A MAN HE WAS WONT TO SAY WITH NO BACKSTAIRS TO HIS MIND
INCRIMINATING FACTS OR CERTAIN LETTERS HE WOULD RING THE CHANGES ON THESE THREE ACCORDING TO THE SEX AND TEMPERAMENT WITH WHICH HE HAD TO DEAL
THE SHAMED AND SUDDENLY LIT EYES AND THEN WHO TOLD YOU MISTER DEASEY SIR OR WHERE DID YOU GET THE LETTER AH NOW THAT WOULD BE TELLING
THOSE WHO ASKED AFTER A GENTLE SIP OR TWO HOW THE LETTER HAD COME INTO HIS HANDS AND THOSE WHO ASKED IMMEDIATELY IF THE LETTER HADN'T BEEN DESTROYED AS A RULE FROM THE TYPE THAT DEMANDED THE LETTER BACK
BUT THOSE WHO ASKED BETWEEN PENSIVE SIPS HOW THE FACTS OR THE LETTER HAD COME HIS WAY THESE WERE THE ONES WHO YIELDED DEASEY THE RICHEST HARVEST OF RATTLING SKELETON BONES
THERE WAS ONE OF THIS NATURE WHICH TROUBLED HIS REST LONG WELL THE WAY OF IT WAS YOU SEE HE PUT IT UP THE CHIMBLEY BUT WHEN THE CHIMBLEY SWEEPERS COME HE TRANSFERRED IT IN HIS WESKIT
THAT FENCES OFF ONE HUMAN SOUL FROM ANOTHER ALL THE SAME SHE SHOOK HER TREMBLING HEAD WHEN DEASEY DREW THE CORK AT HER REFUSAL DEASEY WAS STRUCK WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL COMPASSION
SHOULD BREAK UP THE SPREE BEFORE IT BEGAN THEN I HAD TOLD HOWLAND THAT HE MUST RESERVE FOR ME A SPAN OF GOOD HORSES AND A SLEIGH THAT I COULD PACK SIXTEEN SMALL CHILDREN INTO TIGHT STOWED
HOWLAND IS ALWAYS GOOD ABOUT SUCH THINGS KNEW WHAT THE SLEIGH WAS FOR HAVING DONE THE SAME IN OTHER YEARS AND DOUBLED THE SPAN OF HORSES OF HIS OWN ACCORD BECAUSE THE CHILDREN WOULD LIKE IT BETTER AND IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
AND THEN UP THE HILL AND OVER TO THE NORTH END AND AS FAR AS WE COULD GET THE HORSES UP INTO MOON COURT THAT THEY MIGHT SING TO THE ITALIAN IMAGE MAN WHO GAVE LUCY THE BOY AND DOG IN PLASTER
EVERYWHERE A LITTLE CROWD GATHERED ROUND US AND THEN WE DASHED AWAY FAR ENOUGH TO GATHER QUITE ANOTHER CROWD AND THEN BACK PERHAPS NOT SORRY TO DOUBLE ON OUR STEPS IF NEED WERE AND LEAVING EVERY CROWD WITH A HAPPY THOUGHT OF
WHY I THOUGHT YOU MUST BE ONE OF US INSOLENT KNAVE BEGONE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
PRETENDING TO WIPE AWAY HIS TEARS MY DAUGHTER O KOYO MOURNING OVER HER SEPARATION FROM MY LORD GENZABURO AT FIRST REFUSED ALL SUSTENANCE AND REMAINED NURSING HER SORROWS UNTIL LAST NIGHT HER WOMAN'S HEART FAILING TO BEAR UP AGAINST HER GREAT GRIEF
SAZEN CAME WITH A MESSAGE FROM YOU I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL A DREAM AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE BENT HER HEAD AND SOBBED AGAIN AND IN GENZABURO'S EYES SHE SEEMED MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER
PLAYING ON THE SHAMISEN A SORT OF BANJO AND SINGING BALLADS THEY NEVER MARRY OUT OF THEIR OWN FRATERNITY BUT REMAIN APART A DESPISED AND SHUNNED RACE AT EXECUTIONS BY CRUCIFIXION
AND YORITOMO BECAME THE CHIEF OF ALL THE NOBLE HOUSES IN JAPAN AND FIRST ESTABLISHED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN YORITOMO HAD THUS RAISED HIMSELF TO POWER
AND HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM LIVED AS PEASANTS IN THE SAME VILLAGE INCREASING IN PROSPERITY AND IN GOOD REPUTE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THE PRINCELY LINE OF YORITOMO CAME TO AN END IN THREE GENERATIONS
AND THINKING TO PUNISH THE PEASANT FOR HIS INSOLENCE SAID
SHE RECOVERED HER SPIRITS AT ONCE AND SAYING THAT SHE WOULD GO WITH SAZEN IMMEDIATELY JOYFULLY MADE HER PREPARATIONS THEN SAZEN HAVING ONCE MORE WARNED KIHACHI TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET FROM CHOKICHI AND TO ACT UPON THE LETTER WHICH HE SHOULD SEND HIM
I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING WHY I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOME RESPECTABLE PERSON AND YOU HAVE THE IMPUDENCE TO TELL ME THAT YOUR NAME IS CHOKICHI
CHIRON THE CENTAUR HAD MET HIM AS HE WAS WANDERING THROUGH THE FORESTS ON THE MOUNTAIN PELION AND HAD SENT HIM DOWN INTO IOLCUS THEN THERE CAME TWO MEN WELL SKILLED IN THE HANDLING OF SHIPS TIPHYS AND NAUPLIUS
TWO WHO WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR HUNTING NO TWO COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN THESE TWO WERE THE FIRST WAS ARCAS HE WAS DRESSED IN THE SKIN OF A BEAR HE HAD RED HAIR AND SAVAGE LOOKING EYES
AND FOR ARMS HE CARRIED A MIGHTY BOW WITH BRONZE TIPPED ARROWS THE FOLK WERE WATCHING AN EAGLE AS HE CAME INTO THE CITY AN EAGLE THAT WAS WINGING ITS WAY FAR FAR UP IN THE SKY ARCAS DREW HIS BOW AND WITH ONE ARROW HE BROUGHT THE EAGLE DOWN
JASON HAD THEM TAKE THE BEAM FROM THE ROOF OF THE PALACE
CAME THE NOISE OF HAMMERING IN THE STREET WHERE THE METALWORKERS WERE CAME THE NOISE OF BEATING UPON METALS AS THE SMITHS FASHIONED OUT OF BRONZE ARMOR FOR THE HEROES AND SWORDS AND SPEARS EVERY DAY
STRIFE AND PURSUIT AND FLIGHT TUMULT AND PANIC AND SLAUGHTER THE FIGURE OF FATE WAS THERE DRAGGING A DEAD MAN BY THE FEET
WHAT HIS OBJECT CAN BE IN ACTING THUS IN CONCEALING HIMSELF AFTER RENDERING US SO MANY SERVICES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HIS SERVICES ARE NOT THE LESS REAL
YOU ARE OUR COMPANION YOU HAVE ALREADY ENDANGERED YOUR LIFE SEVERAL TIMES FOR US AND YOU AS WELL AS THE REST OUGHT TO BE CONSULTED IN THE MATTER OF ANY IMPORTANT DECISION SPEAK THEREFORE CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
BEFORE PUTTING THEIR PROJECT OF EXPLORING THE YET UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE ISLAND INTO EXECUTION THEY WISHED TO GET ALL POSSIBLE WORK FINISHED IT WAS ALSO THE TIME FOR COLLECTING THE VARIOUS VEGETABLES FROM THE TABOR ISLAND PLANTS ALL WAS STOWED AWAY
THERE WAS NO FEAR OF DAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THICK MASS OF GRANITE MANY NATURAL EXCAVATIONS SITUATED IN THE UPPER PASSAGE WERE ENLARGED EITHER BY PICK AXE OR MINE AND GRANITE HOUSE THUS BECAME A GENERAL WAREHOUSE
THE TRANSIT DESCRIBED BY THE BALL OUGHT TO BE AS EXTENDED AS POSSIBLE AND THIS TENSION COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE PROJECTILE SHOULD BE IMPELLED WITH A VERY GREAT INITIAL VELOCITY NOW SAID HARDING TO HIS COMPANIONS
AND NOW THE PIECES WERE AS BRILLIANT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ON BOARD A FRIGATE OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY ON THIS DAY THEREFORE IN PRESENCE OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COLONY INCLUDING MASTER JUP AND TOP THE FOUR CANNON WERE SUCCESSIVELY TRIED
PENCROFT THINK OF AYRTON SAID HERBERT TAKING THE SAILOR'S HAND HE BECAME AN HONEST MAN AGAIN PENCROFT LOOKED AT HIS COMPANIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS PROPOSAL BEING MET WITH ANY OBJECTION
THEY ARE SIX AND WELL ARMED IF THEY EACH LAY HID IN A CORNER AND EACH FIRED AT ONE OF US THEY WOULD SOON BE MASTERS OF THE COLONY WHY HAVE THEY NOT DONE SO SAID HERBERT NO DOUBT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR INTEREST TO DO IT BESIDES WE ARE SIX ALSO
AND WE WILL NOT ATTACK THEM UNLESS WE ARE ATTACKED FIRST THUS THEIR BEHAVIOR TOWARDS THE PIRATES WAS AGREED UPON ALTHOUGH PENCROFT AUGURED NOTHING GOOD FROM IT THEY WERE NOT TO ATTACK THEM BUT WERE TO BE ON THEIR GUARD
EVEN THE BALL HAS TRAVERSED THE LUNGS BUT THE PERFORATION OF THIS ORGAN IS NOT FATAL GOD BLESS YOU ANSWERED PENCROFT AS MAY BE BELIEVED DURING THE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS THEY HAD BEEN IN THE CORRAL THE COLONISTS HAD NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT OF NURSING HERBERT
AND AS HE WAS A MAN TO DEFEND HIMSELF HE MUST HAVE BEEN OVERPOWERED YES THAT IS TO BE FEARED SAID THE REPORTER THEN DOUBTLESS THE CONVICTS INSTALLED THEMSELVES IN THE CORRAL WHERE THEY FOUND PLENTY OF EVERYTHING AND ONLY FLED WHEN THEY SAW US COMING
IT IS NOW FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS SINCE HE HAS HAD ANY NEWS OF US HE WILL BE SURE TO COME AND AS HE WILL BE LESS ON HIS GUARD THAN WE SHOULD BE OURSELVES ADDED SPILETT HE WILL BE KILLED IS THERE REALLY NO WAY OF WARNING HIM
HAD ASSERTED THEMSELVES AND EXTENDED THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THE STATE OF URARTU WAS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE AND THE NAIRI TRIBES HAD SPREAD ROUND THE SOUTH EASTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
NOT ONLY FIGHTING MEN BUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE EITHER SLAUGHTERED OR BURNED AT THE STAKE IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THEREFORE THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE KINGS OF PETTY STATES MADE SUBMISSION TO HIM WITHOUT RESISTANCE AS SOON AS HE INVADED THEIR DOMAINS
THESE HE DISPOSED OF WITH CHARACTERISTIC BARBARITY SOME WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND SOME IMPALED ON STAKES WHILE OTHERS WERE ENCLOSED IN A PILLAR WHICH THE KING HAD ERECTED TO REMIND THE ARAMAEANS OF HIS DETERMINATION TO BROOK NO OPPOSITION
AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVETH FURIOUSLY KING JORAM WENT OUT HIMSELF TO MEET THE FAMOUS CHARIOTEER
WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED HE MADE OFFERINGS THERE TO HADAD THE LOCAL THOR AND THEN SUDDENLY MARCHED SOUTHWARD HAZAEL WENT OUT TO OPPOSE THE ADVANCING ASSYRIANS AND CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THEM IN THE VICINITY OF MOUNT HERMON
WHEN HE WAS MURDERED BY HIS SERVANT ZIMRI CAPTAIN OF HALF HIS CHARIOTS WHILE HE WAS DRINKING HIMSELF DRUNK IN THE HOUSE OF ARZA STEWARD OF HIS HOUSE IN TIRZAH
AFTER FOUR YEARS OF CIVIL WAR SHALMANESER DIED HIS CHOSEN HEIR
BUT WAS DEFEATED IN A FIERCE BATTLE ON THE BANKS OF THE DABAN CANAL
FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE GREAT CONQUEROR ENGAGED HIMSELF IN THUS SUBDUING REBELLIOUS TRIBES AND EXTENDING HIS TERRITORY HIS MILITARY HEADQUARTERS WERE AT KALKHI TO WHICH CITY THE COURT HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED
ON ONE OCCASION ASHUR NATSIR PAL SWEPT SOUTHWARD THROUGH THIS REGION AND ATTACKED A COMBINED FORCE OF SUKHI ARAMAEANS AND BABYLONIANS THE BABYLONIANS WERE COMMANDED BY ZABDANU
IN THE EVENING AFTER THE LABOUR OF THE DAY I OFTEN SAT AT THE DOOR OF MY TENT GIVING MYSELF UP TO THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF THAT CALM AND REPOSE WHICH ARE IMPARTED TO THE SENSES BY SUCH SCENES AS THESE
AT FIRST FAINT BECAME LOUDER AS THE FLOCKS RETURNED FROM THEIR PASTURES AND WANDERED AMONGST THE TENTS GIRLS HURRIED OVER THE GREENSWARD TO SEEK THEIR FATHERS CATTLE OR CROUCHED DOWN TO MILK THOSE WHICH HAD RETURNED ALONE TO THEIR WELL REMEMBERED FOLDS
THE ASSYRIAN SCULPTURES OF THIS PERIOD LACK THE TECHNICAL SKILL THE DELICACY AND IMAGINATION OF SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN ART BUT THEY ARE FULL OF ENERGY DIGNIFIED AND MASSIVE AND STRONG AND LIFELIKE
WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER PERIOD OF INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS HIS INVENTION PROBABLY NOTHING MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD OF THE ZEPPELIN AFTER THIS LAST ACCIDENT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE PRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE DIRECT INSTIGATION OF THE KAISER
THIS BLIND CHILD LIKE FAITH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZEPPELIN FACTORIES AT FRIEDRICHSHAFEN THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE TWO OF THESE VESSELS PER MONTH WHILE ANOTHER FACTORY OF A SIMILAR CAPACITY
ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN IS THE MAIN STAKE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO AERIAL CONQUEST OTHER TYPES OF AIRSHIPS HAVE NOT BEEN IGNORED AS RELATED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER THEY HAVE BEEN FOSTERED UPON A SMALLER BUT EQUALLY EFFECTIVE SCALE
SO FAR AS TEUTON EFFORT IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY IT HAS PLACED MANY NOTABLE FLIGHTS TO ITS CREDIT THE GROSS AIRSHIP IS AN EQUALLY SERVICEABLE CRAFT
FOR IN HIS OLD AGE HE HELD THAT RANK IN THE MILITIA OF THE DISTRICT AND A VERY FINE LOOKING SOLDIER HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIS PRIME JUDGING FROM THE PORTRAIT WHICH USED TO HANG IN THE LIBRARY REPRESENTING A FULL FORMED MAN TALL AND ERECT
WITH STREETS AND CROSS STREETS OF PINE BOOK SHELVES UNPAINTED ALL FILLED WITH BOOKS TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY A WILDERNESS OF BOOKS IN PRINT AND IN MANUSCRIPT MOSTLY OLD AND DINGY
BUT OLD PETER FORCE COULD SHOW YOU SINGLE ALCOVES OF HIS LIBRARY WHICH AT A FAIR VALUATION WOULD BUY OUT ALL THAT MASS OF SUMPTUOSITY IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS DUSTY DINGY WILDERNESS
PETER FORCE WAS A VERY GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THE OLD MERCHANT'S DOCTRINE HE GOT ALL THESE PRECIOUS THINGS BECAUSE HE WANTED THEM WITH A SUSTAINED PASSION OF DESIRE FOR HALF A CENTURY THERE NEVER WAS A TIME WHEN HE WOULD NOT HAVE GLADLY GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
AND PERHAPS LOST FOREVER TO THE COUNTRY AT LENGTH CONGRESS HAVING SANCTIONED THE ENLARGEMENT OF THEIR OWN LIBRARY THEIR LIBRARIAN MISTER SPOFFORD INDUCED THEM TO PURCHASE THE WHOLE MASS JUST AS IT STOOD
AND HER NIECE AS THEY WERE TAKING EARLY TEA AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST IN THE FORMER LADY'S APARTMENT AND WONDERED HOW THE RAWDING CRAWLEYS COULD GIT ON THE VALET HAD DAMPED AND FOLDED THE PAPER ONCE MORE
SO THAT IT LOOKED QUITE FRESH AND INNOCENT AGAINST THE ARRIVAL OF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE POOR RAWDON TOOK UP THE PAPER AND BEGAN TO TRY AND READ IT UNTIL HIS BROTHER SHOULD ARRIVE
HIS SCANTY HAIR COMBED AND OILED TRIMMING HIS NAILS AS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS MAJESTICALLY IN A STARCHED CRAVAT AND A GREY FLANNEL DRESSING GOWN A REAL OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IN A WORD
WENT THROUGH THE COURT LAST WEEK AND WAS WHAT THEY CALL WHITEWASHED I BELIEVE LORD RAGLAND WOULD NOT PAY A SHILLING FOR HIM AND IT'S NOT MONEY I WANT RAWDON BROKE IN I'M NOT COME TO YOU ABOUT MYSELF
IT WAS DAMNED UNFRIENDLY MAC SAID RAWDON QUITE OVERCOME AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS HE GAVE WAY TO AN EMOTION THE SIGHT OF WHICH CAUSED THE TOUGH OLD CAMPAIGNER
BUT ABOUT GOING HOME NEXT SATURDAY WHEN HIS FATHER WOULD CERTAINLY TIP HIM AND PERHAPS WOULD TAKE HIM TO THE PLAY HE'S A REGULAR TRUMP THAT BOY THE FATHER WENT ON STILL MUSING ABOUT HIS SON
I WISH I WAS RAWDON REPLIED IF IT WASN'T FOR LITTLE RAWDON I'D HAVE CUT MY THROAT THIS MORNING AND THAT DAMNED VILLAIN'S TOO
BUT HIS HANDS SHOOK AND HE WAS SO AGITATED THAT THE POCKET BOOK FELL FROM HIM AND OUT OF IT THE THOUSAND POUND NOTE WHICH HAD BEEN THE LAST OF THE UNLUCKY BECKY'S WINNINGS
SHE WAS VERY DISTRAITE NERVOUS SILENT AND ILL TO PLEASE THE FAMILY HAD NEVER KNOWN HER SO PEEVISH SHE GREW PALE AND ILL
UNTIL ADVERTISERS ARE FORCED TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND CIRCULARS THEIR ONLY LEGITIMATE CHANNELS THIS MUCH MISTER FORBES HAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU AND HE WILL NOW TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IF HE IS ELECTED
HE PROPOSES TO DO KENNETH THEN TOOK THE PLATFORM AND WAS WELCOMED WITH A HEARTY CHEER HE MODESTLY ASSURED THEM THAT A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD ACCOMPLISH MUCH GOOD FOR HIS DISTRICT
SHE DID NOT SPEAK TO THEM AT ONCE BUT WENT AND STOOD BY THE MANTEL LOOKING UP LONG AND EARNESTLY AT THE PORTRAIT OF THE TWINS MY BABIES THEY HEARD HER MURMUR UNCONSCIOUSLY ALOUD
I LITTLE KNEW HIM I HARDLY NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE AWFUL DAY THAT HE CAME HOME YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF IT THAT AFTERNOON SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED
I WAS TOO HURRIED AND NERVOUS WHEN I CAME IN TO THINK OF IT THAT'S IT THEN SOME ONE HAS SEEN IT OPEN AND HAS STOPPED TO INQUIRE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT SHE HURRIED AWAY TO THE FRONT DOOR
AND I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHETHER THE HOUSE WAS STILL IN THEIR POSSESSION IT SEEMED TO BE UNTENANTED AT HIS MENTION OF KNOWING THE FAMILY JOYCE LOOKED HIM OVER WITH CONSIDERABLY MORE INTEREST HE WAS TALL STRAIGHT AND ROBUST
THERE IS ONE OF THE FAMILY HERE TO DAY ON ON BUSINESS SHE SAID AT LAST IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR NAME I WILL ASK IF THAT PERSON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU OH THAT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE
BUT YOU LITTLE LADY SEEM QUITE INTIMATE WITH THE COLLINGWOOD FAMILY HISTORY TELL ME ARE YOU A A RELATIVE THIS CONFUSED JOYCE ANEW
WHEN ON THE FACES THAT ENCIRCLE HIM HE SEES NOT ONE WEARING AN EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY THERE IS NOT EVEN PITY ALL APPEAR TO FROWN UPON HIM
THE JURY HAS GIVEN A JUST VERDICT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE FORFEITED MY LIFE AND DESERVE TO LOSE IT
A NEW SENSATION MAKES ITSELF MANIFEST AMONG THE SPECTATORS IT PARTAKES OF SURPRISE CURIOSITY AND INCREDULITY NO ONE SPEAKS OR IN ANY WAY ATTEMPTS INTERRUPTION
AND GOD KNOWS I WAS SORRY ENOUGH ON DISCOVERING THAT I HAD MADE IT I DIDN'T KNOW MYSELF TILL LONG AFTER THE CONDEMNED MAN LOOKS UP AS IF IN HOPES THAT HE HAS TOUCHED A CHORD OF MERCY
THE SPEAKER RESTS HIS EYE
DO NOT REPROACH THE YOUNG CREOLE BECAUSE THIS PASSION WAS PARAMOUNT IN HER SOUL DO NOT BLAME HER FOR FEELING PLEASURE AMIDST MOMENTS THAT SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO SADNESS
AND WHAT A POOR COMPENSATION IT SEEMED TO THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN EXACTING IT AS THEY STOOD GAZING UPON THE REMAINS OF THE VILLAIN AND HIS VICTIM THE SWARTH RUFFIAN DANGLING FROM THE BRANCH ABOVE
AND SCARCELY KNOW A WORD OF ENGLISH YET A FAT PHLEGMATIC LOOKING BABY IS PEACEFULLY REPOSING IN A CRADLE WHICH IS SIMPLY HALF A MONSTER PUMPKIN SCOOPED OUT AND DRIED IT IS THE MOST INTENSELY RUSTIC CRADLE IN THE WORLD
LEADING THROUGH THE BROAD AND SMILING CATTARAUGUS VALLEY THAT IS SPREAD OUT LIKE A VAST GARDEN BELOW THROUGH WHICH CATTARAUGUS CREEK SLOWLY WINDS ITS TORTUOUS WAY STOPPING OVER NIGHT AT ANGOLA
AND HOLDS HER LONG STIFF BUGGY WHIP SO THAT IT SWIPES ME VICIOUSLY ACROSS THE FACE KNOCKS MY HELMET OFF INTO THE MUD DITCH
BUT FOR ALL THAT IT WOULD BE GOING TOO FAR TO SAY THAT I WAS N'T A DOCTOR T IS THE SAME WITH PHYSIC AND POETRY YOU TAKE TO IT OR YOU DON'T TAKE TO IT THERE'S CHAPS AY AND FAR FROM STUPID ONES EITHER
THE BETTER TO ADMIT AIR TO THE SICK MAN AS BILLY DREW NIGH WITH CAUTIOUS STEPS HE PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH WORN AND WASTED BY LONG ILLNESS THE PATIENT WAS A MAN STILL IN THE VERY PRIME OF LIFE
CRIED HE ANGRILY WHAT I AM IS N'T SO AISY TO SAY BUT WHO I AM IS CLEAN BEYOND ME ARE YOU A DOCTOR ASKED THE SICK MAN FIERCELY I'M AFEAR'D I'M NOT
I'LL HAVE THAT HAIR OFF OF HIM IF HE IS N'T COOLER TOWARDS EVENING SO SAYING HE COVERED THE SICK MAN WITH THE WETTED CLOTHS AND BATHED HIS HANDS IN THE COOLING FLUID
SAID BILLY I'LL HAVE TO BE UP AT THE OFFICE FOR THE BAGS AT SIX O'CLOCK FAIX
SORRA TASTE OF IT MUTTERED ANOTHER THERE'S A SEA RUNNIN OUTSIDE NOW THAT WOULD SWAMP A LIFE BOAT I'LL NOT LOSE AN ILLIGANT SITUATION OF SIX POUNDS TEN A YEAR
SAID BILLY BUT EVIDENTLY YIELDING AN UNWILLING ASSENT TO THIS DOCTRINE THE GERMANS HAS A FINE NATIONAL MUSIC AND THEY RE GREAT FOR HARMONY BUT HARMONY AND MELODY IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND WHICH IS BEST BILLY ASKED ONE OF THE COMPANY
THE POET WAS WELL AWARE THAT HE WAS SECURING THEIR HEARTIEST APPROVAL NOR WAS BILLY INSENSIBLE TO SUCH FLATTERIES THE IRRITABILE GENUS HAS ITS SOFT SIDE AND CAN ENJOY TO THE UTTERMOST ITS OWN SUCCESSES
AND I STRETCHED MYSELF DOWN AT THE WATER'S EDGE AND I FELL INTO A FIT OF MUSING IT'S OFTEN AND OFTEN I TRIED TO REMEMBER THE ELEGANT FANCIES THAT CAME THROUGH MY HEAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT I THOUGHT I SAW THAT NIGHT OUT ON THE LAKE FORNINT ME
YE SEE I WAS FRESH AND FASTIN I NEVER TASTED A BIT THE WHOLE DAY AND MY BRAIN MAYBE WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR SOMEHOW JANIUS REAL JANIUS THRIVES BEST ON A LITTLE STARVATION AND FROM MUSING
TILL AT LAST HE GAVE OUT IN ALL THE FULNESS OF HIS LIQUID VOICE THEM ELEGANT LINES OUT OF POPE'S HOMER AS WHEN THE MOON REFULGENT LAMP OF NIGHT O'ER HEAVEN'S CLEAR AZURE SPREADS HER SACRED LIGHT
REGRETTING HIS DIMINISHING ABILITY TO SLEEP IN THE EARLY MORNING NOW EVEN WHEN HE WAS IN THE STRONG AND SOOTHING AIR OF MID ATLANTIC AND THINKING OF V V BECAUSE SHE HAD A WAY OF COMING INTO HIS MIND WHEN IT WAS UNDEFENDED
HE IS THE SORT OF MAN WHO CAN ARRANGE THINGS LIKE THAT THERE'LL BE SOMEONE AT FALMOUTH TO LOOK AFTER US AND PUT US ABOARD THE LINER I MUST WIRE THEM WHERE I CAN PICK UP A TELEGRAM TO MORROW WELLS IN SOMERSET
SEEMED TO BEAR THE CLOSEST RELATION TO THE RESEARCHES WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO COMMENCE
IS THE CHILD OF YOUR THOUGHT
CHRONICLED WITH MORE OR LESS SKILL NO POSITIVE INFORMATION HAD BEEN GAINED EITHER AS TO THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EVIL OR AS TO ITS REMEDY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
DO YOU THINK THAT ONE CAN BE A ROBBER WITHOUT KNOWING IT WITHOUT WISHING IT WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT DO YOU NOT ADMIT THAT SOCIETY IN ITS PRESENT STATE LIKE EVERY MAN
THAT IS WHAT I SAID TO THE INSTITUTE AT THE TIME WHEN I PRESENTED MY REPORT UPON YOUR BOOK I KNEW THAT THEY WISHED TO PROCEED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURTS YOU PERHAPS DO NOT KNOW BY HOW NARROW A CHANCE I SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING THEM
BUT SEE TO IT SIR THAT ERE LONG THEY DO NOT COME IN SPITE OF YOU TO SEEK FOR AMMUNITION IN THIS FORMIDABLE ARSENAL AND THAT YOUR VIGOROUS METAPHYSICS FALLS NOT INTO THE HANDS OF SOME SOPHIST OF THE MARKET PLACE
TO YOU GENTLEMEN WILL REDOUND ALL THE GLORY FOR IT IS TO YOUR AID AND YOUR INSPIRATION THAT I OWE IT MY PURPOSE IN THIS WORK IS THE APPLICATION OF METHOD
BUT I SHOULD BE UNJUST DID I NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THIS PRETENDED SCIENCE AND THE MEN WHO PRACTISE IT DEVOTED TO STUDIES BOTH LABORIOUS AND SEVERE
AND WE BUILD HENCEFORTH UPON THE SAND INSTEAD OF ON A ROCK THAT I CANNOT AGREE TO AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE CRITICISED YOUR BOOK SO FULL OF BEAUTIFUL PAGES
SO BRILLIANT WITH KNOWLEDGE AND FERVOR I WISH SIR THAT MY IMPAIRED HEALTH WOULD PERMIT ME TO EXAMINE WITH YOU PAGE BY PAGE THE MEMOIR WHICH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO ADDRESS TO ME PUBLICLY AND PERSONALLY
WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO LABOR TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONG I TRY TO SERVE AND ENLIGHTEN THEM WHEREAS SOME ENDEAVOR TO MISLEAD THEM
I SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THIS NOBLE AND ELOQUENT LETTER BUT I CONFESS THAT I AM MORE INCLINED TO REALIZE THE PREDICTION WITH WHICH IT TERMINATES THAN TO AUGMENT NEEDLESSLY THE NUMBER OF MY ANTAGONISTS
I CALL PROPERTY
IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE AND TO FORMULATE THE SYSTEM WHICH MUST PROCEED FROM IT STILL FURTHER IT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW THE METHOD BY WHICH THE NEW SYSTEM
WILL SATISFY ALL THE MORAL AND POLITICAL NEEDS WHICH INDUCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS THEN OF SUBSEQUENT EVIDENCE DEPENDS THE CORRECTNESS OF MY PRECEDING ARGUMENTS
IN PRUNING AN OLD TREE WE GUARD AGAINST DESTRUCTION OF THE BUDS AND FRUIT YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS ANY ONE YOU ARE A WISE AND LEARNED MAN YOU HAVE A THOUGHTFUL MIND
MANY A WEARY MILE HE TRAMPED DAY AFTER DAY UNTIL ONE MORNING HE SAW BEFORE HIM JUST SUCH A FOREST AS THAT IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED AND HE STEPPED JOYFULLY INTO IT LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO MEET AN OLD FRIEND
BUT THREE RARE AND BEAUTIFUL ANKLETS AND THESE HE DULY PRESENTED TO THE KING ON THE VERY DAY THAT HIS MONTH OF GRACE WAS OVER THE KING EMBRACED HIM WARMLY AND MADE HIM RICH GIFTS AND THE NEXT DAY THE VAIN PRINCESS PUT TWO ANKLETS ON EACH FOOT
AND HER HEAD HER WORDS TURNED AMEER ALI PALE WITH HORROR BUT SHE REMINDED HIM THAT NO HARM HAD COME TO HER BEFORE AND AT LAST HE CONSENTED TO DO AS SHE BADE HIM
THE KING SAID HE HAD PLENTY OF SERVANTS AND WANTED NO MORE
BUT A HORRID KIND OF WITCH WHO REALLY LIVED IN WITCHLAND AND HAD NO BUSINESS ON EARTH IF EVER A MAN STRAYED INTO WITCHLAND THE OGRESSES USED TO EAT HIM UP AND THIS OLD WITCH THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIKE TO CATCH A MAN FOR SUPPER
AMEER ALI BOWED LOW AND ANSWERED THAT HE HAD DONE AND WOULD DO THE KING ALL THE SERVICE THAT LAY IN HIS POWER SAVE ONLY THIS ONE THING THE KING WHO CONSIDERED HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND A PRIZE FOR ANY MAN FLEW INTO A PASSION AND THE PRINCESS WAS MORE FURIOUS STILL
WHO THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANYONE ELSE TO GAIN BOTH THE THRONE AND THE PRINCESS AS SOON AS THE KING WAS SEATED HE CALLED UPON AN USHER TO SUMMON THE FIRST CLAIMANT BUT JUST THEN A FARMER WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF THE CROWD CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD A PETITION TO OFFER
TO MISTAKE THE HOWL OF A JACKAL FOR THE HUNTING CRY OF A TIGER THE KING TURNED FIRST RED AND THEN PALE THERE IS CONTINUED THE FARMER A ROYAL TIGER BRED IN THE FOREST WHO HAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TRUE CLAIM TO YOUR THRONE WHERE
WHEN WAR WAS DECLARED MISS CAVELL LOST NO TIME IN HURRYING BACK TO BRUSSELS BELIEVING THAT HER DUTY CALLED HER THERE SHE WROTE A LETTER COMMENTING ON THE GERMAN ARMY WHEN IT SWEPT THROUGH BELGIUM AND IN IT SHE VOICED HER PITY FOR THE TIRED FOOTSORE GERMAN SOLDIERS
AND FURNISHING THEM WITH GUIDES TO HELP THEM TO THE DUTCH FRONTIER WHENCE THEY MIGHT ESCAPE INTO HOLLAND AND RETURN TO ENGLAND THIS WAS THE GERMAN STATEMENT IF WHAT THEY SAID WERE TRUE THERE WAS STILL NO CAUSE FOR KILLING THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN IN THEIR POWER
AND WILLINGLY GAVE HER LIFE FOR HER COUNTRY HER WORDS RESEMBLED THOSE OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK DEATH SHE SAID WAS WELL KNOWN TO HER AND SHE HAD SEEN IT SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOT STRANGE OR FEARFUL TO HER
OH DON'T YOU SEE TOO THAT IF THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE TIME WE OUGHT TO SPEND IT TOGETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID IT'S NO GOOD I MUST SET MY TEETH AND BEAR IT AND YOU I HOPE IT WON'T BE AS HARD FOR YOU AS IT WILL FOR ME
AND THOUGH HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF THE JOY OF SPEAKING IN WORDS HE HAD LET HIS EYES SPEAK MORE THAN HE KNEW AND NOW HE HAD REACHED THE WALLFLOWERS HIGH UP AND WAS PLUCKING THEM AND THROWING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY FELL IN A WAVERING BRIGHT SHOWER ROUND HER FEET

THE YOUNG MAN MADE A REVERENT NOTE OF THE NAME AND THE INTERVIEW SEEMED PLAYED OUT IT'S A COMPLICATED NUISANCE THE FATHER MUSED IT ISN'T EVEN AS IF I KNEW ANYTHING OF THE CHAP I OUGHTN'T TO HAVE ALLOWED THE CHILD TO MAKE THESE LONG VISITS TO HER AUNT
